"A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, she would keep her limbs in a specific position to allow her body weight to be supported. Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.","{

"This is the case of a 56-year-old man that was complaining of a dump pain on the right back and a swelling right in this place for several weeks. The patient was in good state and very active. There was not any health problem in the past except a thoracic trauma at work one year ago. In that time the patient was diagnosed with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib without any other consequences.\nOn the X-ray was seen a shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax. After that, it was decided to perform a CT-scan of the thorax that revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax that measured 8 × 4 cm and had a heterogeneous density inside of it. The tumor had involved and destructed the 9th rib and was lying even in two adjacent intercostal spaces, but without involving the lung and muscular layers. On lung window of the CT-scan were seen micronodular infiltrations of both lungs with diameters up to 5 mm and only one nodule in lower lobe of the right lung with diameter almost 1 cm (). The mediastinum was without enlarged lymph nodes and no other lesion was seen in adjacent organs. The conclusion of the radiologist was that probably this was the case of a malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs and a biopsy of the tumor was recommended.\nBecause there was not a correlation between the clinical picture of the patient and the conclusion of the radiology it was decided to perform frozen biopsy of the lesions of the right lung and an excision biopsy of the tumor of the thoracic wall. So, through a small posterior thoracotomy at 7th intercostal space were sampled five nodular lesions from the right lung and a sample from the tumor. None of these samples resulted positive (no malignant cells found) after frozen biopsy. In such conditions was considered as more realistic the option of performing an oncologic resection of the tumor of the thoracic wall. (We resected three ribs where the 8th and 10th ribs were macroscopically free of the tumor. The resection was extended 10 cm anteriorly from the tumor and posteriorly it was accompanied by disarticulation of the ribs and partial resection of transversal processes of 8th, 9th, and 10th vertebras.) After that, we have performed a plastic procedure with polypropylene mesh in double layers to correct the defect. The clinical course of the patient was very good and five days later he was discharged from the hospital in very good condition. The conclusion of biopsy for both the tumor of thoracic wall and the lung nodules was sclerosing xanthofibroma which is considered by most people to be a tumor with different clinical and radiological features. Lesions were characterized by a network of anastomosing bone trabeculae without osteoblast lining within a fibrous stroma ().\nReferring to the follow-up, the patient was in a great state of health and from the first month after the surgery he turned back at his work place. Two years after the surgery the thoracic CT-scan showed neither recurrences of the lesions of the thoracic wall nor new developments on the lungs.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back', 'Restriction of body movements', 'Abnormal positioning of the head and back'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant injury history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI scan of the brain', 'Finding': 'No abnormalities detected'}, {'Test': 'USG of the abdomen', 'Finding': 'No abnormalities detected'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Tardive dystonia', 'Type': 'Drug-induced', 'Location': 'Neck, back'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Tetrabenazine', 'Details': 'Built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Improvement in abnormal movements', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved ability to stand and perform daily chores'}}}"
"A 36-year old female patient visited our hospital with a chief complaint of pain and restricted range of motion (ROM) in the left hip joint persisting for two months. Physical examination of the patient revealed severe gait disturbance secondary to hip pain aggravated by hip joint flexion or rotation. The patient had no lifestyle habits or specific comorbidities thought to cause femoral head AVN. An anteroposterior view of the left hip revealed sclerosis and collapse of the femoral head and dysplasia of the hip (). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed an increased amount of joint fluid and bone marrow edema in the left hip, and femoral head necrosis was detected on the contralateral side; however, the patient did not complain of any pain (). The patient underwent THA after being diagnosed with idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, was discharged in good condition three weeks after the surgery without specific complications, and followed up via regular outpatient visits. The patient complained of pain and limited ROM in the contralateral hip joint and gait disturbance one year after the initial surgery. Her symptoms continued for two months and increased over the following three weeks. Repeat MRI revealed similar findings to those noted previously in the left hip (). A second THA was performed (one year after the first THA of the left hip); the patient was discharged in good condition after the surgery without specific complications and followed up via regular outpatient visits (). At the time of the second surgery, the patient was 7 kg heavier than she was at the time of the first procedure and developed a moderate moon face, signs that were initially overlooked as weight gain. Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery. However, these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central obesity and muscle mass reduction of the limbs and hot flushes. She was diagnosed with hypertension due to high blood pressure and electrolyte inbalance and prescribed medication. She was suspected of having secondary hypertension, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were conducted. Although echocardiography yielded no specific findings, abdominal CT detected a 2.5 cm benign adrenal adenoma (). The patient was immediately referred to the Department of Endocrinology to be screened for Cushing's syndrome. During screening, a 24-hour urine free cortisol revealed an elevation to 394.3 µg/day (normal, >50 µg/day) and a plasma cortisol level of 29.0 µg/dL (normal, <5.0 µg/dL) was noted based on the results of a 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 21.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6–76 pg/mL) and cortisol levels between 17.3 and 19.9 µg/day in a high-dose dexamethasone test confirmed Cushing's syndrome. A suspected cause was ectopic ACTH-producing tumors due to an adrenocortical adenoma. An in-depth history was then undertaken. The patient disregarded advice to undergo regular monitoring of a small abdominal mass found in a regular check-up done several years before her first visit to our hospital. At the time, she had menstrual irregularity, mild weight gain, depression and intermittent facial skin problems–clinical signs associated with Cushing's syndrome. We determined that asymptomatic AI developed into symptomatic Cushing's syndrome, and the patient underwent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy after referral to our urology department (). Histopathological examination confirmed cortical adenoma. Six months after the procedure, Cushing's syndrome-related symptoms completely disappeared, including feelings of helplessness and central obesity. The patient is currently under outpatient observation without any specific symptoms.\nThe patient's informed consent and institutional review board's clearance were obtained for the purpose of publication of a case report. This article was approved by Gwangju Veterans Hospital at July 2, 2018 (project number, GVHIRB 18-0023).","{

"A 49-year-old male presented with a complaint of pain in the left proximal forearm after a fall. The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.\nIn the operating room the patient was placed in a supine position and a posterior incision centered over the elbow was performed. A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work. Radiographs showed a healed ulna nonunion and a stable total elbow prosthesis without signs of loosening (). Multiple attempts to contact the patient for further follow-up have been unsuccessful.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of pain and swelling in the right back for several weeks', 'No significant health problems except a thoracic trauma one year prior'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Thoracic trauma with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'A shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'A tumor with heterogeneous density and destruction of the 9th rib'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Sclerosing xanthofibroma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Thoracic wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical resection and plastic repair', 'Details': 'Involving three ribs and reconstruction with polypropylene mesh'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Two years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient returned to work one month after surgery'}}}"
"A 47-year-old male patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic because of recurrent attacks of pain in both knees over 1 year.\nIn September 2016, the patient presented with severe pain over the medial aspect of the left knee for a two-week duration which prevented him from ambulation. The pain increased with weight-bearing physical activity. The patient reported no history of trauma before the onset of the knee pain. Examination showed severe tenderness over the medial side of the knee with mild effusion and moderate limitation of range of motion. There was no erythema or increased warmth of the knee. MRI of the left knee showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema/contusion involving the medial femoral condyle in mid and anterior parts predominantly along the articular surface. The patient was prescribed diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice daily and was advised to avoid prolonged weight-bearing activities. Over the next few weeks, the pain subsided and resolved. Three months later, the patient developed spontaneous new onset of pain involving the lateral aspect of the same knee. MRI showed bone marrow edema involving the lateral femoral condyle with complete resolution of the bone marrow edema of the medial femoral condyle. He was treated conservatively with NSAIDs and physiotherapy and advised to use cane to minimize weight bearing on the diseased knee. demonstrates MRI of the left knee in September 2016 and three months later.\nIn April 2017, the patient developed gradual pain over the medial side of the right knee with no obvious swelling. MRI of the right knee showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema involving the medial tibial plateau medially and anteriorly. The patient was treated conservatively in a similar fashion to the previous episode. Four months later, the pain got more severe for which he underwent another MRI of the right knee which showed extensive marrow edema involving the medial femoral condyle with complete recovery of the medial tibial plateau bone marrow edema noted in the previous MRI (). The patient also recalled a similar pain happened in 2011 to the left knee but did not do MRI at that time.\nIn all previous presentations, the patient did not report any history of trauma, fall, twist, constitutional symptoms, or using corticosteroids. He also had no history of other joint involvement apart from knees and denied any history of low back pain. He did not have any features suggestive of spondyloarthropathy or connective tissue disease.\nPast history is significant for fracture of the greater tuberosity of the left humerus and undisplaced fracture of the left cuboid bone. Fractures happened after he fell off a ladder. Also, he is known to have mild asthma which is controlled with as-needed bronchodilator and hypertension maintained on amlodipine 5 mg daily. The patient had never been a smoker or an alcohol consumer.\nLab investigations revealed vitamin D 8 ng/mL (normal: >30 ng/mL), corrected calcium 2.16 mmol/L (normal: 2.10–2.60 mmol/L), parathyroid hormone 91 pg/ml (normal: 15–65 pg/ml), and alkaline phosphatase 49 U/L (normal: 40–150 U/L). Complete blood count, kidney and liver function, CRP, and ESR were within normal limit. Immunology profile including rheumatoid factor, ACPA, ANA, anticardiolipin, and B2-glycoprotein were all negative.\nDXA scan showed a T score of −1.0 at the lumbar spine and −1.6 at the left femoral neck suggestive of osteopenia. shows further details of the DXA scan.\nThe patient was treated conservatively with oral vitamin D2 50,000 IU/week supplement and NSAIDs. Gradually, the symptoms subsided over the next few weeks, and vitamin D level became normal after 12 weeks.","{

"A 24-year-old Yemeni female presented to the endocrinology clinic in April 2017 because of inability to walk and a long history of osteomalacia. She was unable to walk for the last 4 years with severe weakness and bone pain. She reported that for the last 2 years she was so weak that she could not turn over in bed and this was associated with pain all over her body. Her condition started as a baby as she did not walk till she was 2.5 years old. Then when she started school she stated she could walk but could never run, the family was poor and never sought medical help for her condition. She got married at a young age of 15 and became pregnant soon after that. During her pregnancy she had difficulty in walking and had pain in her legs, she needed assistance to rise from the sitting position and she was told she would need a cesarean section because she had a contracted pelvis, but she went into labor before she was able to have a cesarean section and she delivered vaginally and developed a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.\nHer condition over the following years worsened and she was having more difficulty in walking and needed assistance in climbing stairs. She went to several orthopedic surgeons and she was diagnosed as osteomalacia and given calcium and vitamin D without any improvement, till she became totally bedridden. At one time she was also given calcitriol in small doses and for short periods of time 0.25 mg daily. She eventually stopped all treatments when she did not see any improvement in her condition. She was also seen by a neurologist and was found to have a normal nerve conduction study and was told there was no evidence of neurological disease.\nShe has no family history of a similar condition in her parents or siblings or other relatives.\nAt her initial presentation, physical examination of the patient showed that she was 144 cm tall and weighed 49 kg, she was much shorter than the rest of her family. She had normal teeth and hair development. Examination was within normal limits except that she had generalized weakness and tenderness in her extremities with bowing of the legs and genu valgus. All the blood work that the patient had from 2012 to 2019 can be seen in Table .","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of pain and restricted range of motion in the left hip joint for two months', 'Severe gait disturbance caused by hip pain aggravated by flexion or rotation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'SpecificComorbidities': 'None', 'Symptoms': 'Femoral head AVN', 'PreviousSurgery': 'Total hip arthroplasty (THA)'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Anteroposterior view of the left hip', 'Finding': 'Sclerosis, collapse of the femoral head, and hip dysplasia'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Increased joint fluid, bone marrow edema in the left hip, and femoral head necrosis on the contralateral side'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head', 'Type': 'Musculoskeletal disorder', 'Location': 'Hip joint'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Total hip arthroplasty (THA)', 'Details': 'Surgery on left hip joint to replace the femoral head and acetabulum'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Discharged in good condition after three weeks', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Regular outpatient visits', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Symptoms persisted in contralateral hip one year after initial surgery'}}}"
"We report a 24-day-old female baby who presented with dyspnea and fever. Examination showed decreased air entry on the left side and a subsequent chest radiograph showed what looked like a consolidation of that lung and air-filled bowel loops inside the chest and a further ultrasound examination also identified intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney. A computed tomography (CT) of her thorax was performed, which confirmed left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a normal looking, completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery with no antenatal diagnosis; she had normal Apgar score and did not require any resuscitation.\nThe procedure was performed in left lateral decubitus position. A 5 mm camera port was inserted by open technique in anterior axillary and two 3 mm working ports were inserted under vision on either side of camera port. The examination confirmed the CT findings (\n). The herniated large and small bowel was pushed and reduced into the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect which then revealed a completely intrathoracic kidney encased in Gerota's fascia (\n).\nThe kidney was then reduced into the abdominal cavity retroperitoneally by pushing it down through the diaphragmatic defect (\n). A primary repair using interrupted nonabsorbable sutures was achieved without tension (\n). Initially the gas pressure during the reduction in hernia contents was kept at 6 mm Hg but was then reduced to 4 mm Hg during closure of the defect. A chest drain was left in situ through the 5 mm port site at the end of procedure as there was violation of the pleura.\nThe baby had uneventful recovery and was extubated within 24 hours and chest drain was removed after 48 hours. Renal ultrasound scan showed a correctly positioned kidney with good perfusion and no signs of obstruction. She was discharged on day 5 postoperatively and is being followed up as an outpatient; her most recent renal ultrasound scan done 3 years postoperatively showed well and equally perfused kidneys with comparable renal volumes bilaterally without any evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter, or recurrence of the diaphragmatic hernia.\nDuring admission, the patient's mother gave a similar family history—her sister had had a similar condition at birth more than three decades ago. She had open repair of her diaphragmatic hernia at which an intrathoracic kidney was also found and reduced into the abdominal cavity. In the previous months, she had been diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in that kidney and she had just undergone a left radical nephrectomy for her condition. The child's parent asked whether she might have an increased risk of having similarly effected children and whether her daughter now had a higher risk of developing renal cell carcinoma in this kidney.","{

"A 16 years old female patient presented to us with inability to walk on both lower limbs since last 3 months. Earlier the patient was able to walk with a limp and would sway to either side while walking. Three months back patient experienced sudden onset pain in her right groin region while walking and the patient was not able to bear weight on her right lower limb. Then patient was walking with support, bearing weight on her left lower limb. In about a week, patient experienced similar pain in her left groin and was not able to bear weight on either lower limb since then and was left bed ridden. Clinical findings were consistent with coxa vara deformity of bilateral hips with a possibility of bilateral non-union of pathological fracture of femur neck. There was no evidence of any endocrine disturbance, or altered pigmentation or precocious puberty.\nOn imaging it was concluded that the patient suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd’s crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non – union of pathological fracture of neck femur (). Imaging of the other bones showed evidence of the fibrous dysplastic lesions in the shaft of left tibia ( and ). Magnetic resonance scanning of the bilateral hip region showed the features consistent with fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur shaft along with sub - capital fracture of femur neck without evidence of avascular necrosis of the femur head (). All the blood and serum biochemical investigations of the patient like the hemoglobin, total and differential white cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C – reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels and all the hormonal studies were within normal limits. It was decided to do both correction of the deformity to realign the head, neck and shaft; and to achieve valgus at the neck - shaft region and a horizontal configuration neck fracture increasing the chances of union of pathological fracture of neck femur, in one stage, each side at a time.\nOn the right side, first oblique osteotomy was done from just distal to the greater trochanter up to the level of the neck to separate the greater trochanter and the second, lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomy was done at the subtrochanteric level to achieve alignment of the shaft with the proximal femur. With traction neck was aligned to the head and fixed with a 135° Dynamic Richard’s screw with a long side plate. The high riding greater trochanter was aligned with the neck and held with a tension band wire from above and medial to the abductors to hold the greater trochanter aligned.\n2 months later on the left side double lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomies were performed both at the subtrochanteric level to achieve the valgus at the neck – proximal femur shaft junction and to align the distal shaft with the proximal femur. After full correction the head and neck were aligned and the vertical geometry of pathological fracture neck femur was converted into a more horizontal one increasing the chances of union of the fracture. Fixation was done using a 135° Dynamic Richard’s screw with a long side plate to span both the osteotomy sites.\nPost – operatively we achieved a neck shaft angle of 135° on right side and 133° on the left side (). Patient was started on active and passive quadriceps strengthening exercises and after 6 weeks of immobilization toe touch weight bearing was started followed gradually by partial and complete weight bearing mobilization. Follow up imaging showed union at both the osteotomy sites bilaterally and also at the site of the pathological fracture of neck femur. Presently, at 18 months post – operatively (), patient is walking full weight bearing without support and there are no signs of recurrence of lesions of fibrous dysplasia or the deformity.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaint of pain in the left proximal forearm after a fall', 'History of left elbow arthrodesis for posttraumatic arthritis'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Left elbow arthrodesis performed at the age of 18'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographs of forearm and elbow', 'Finding': 'Elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Ulnar nonunion', 'Type': 'Non-healing fracture', 'Location': 'Proximal ulna'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Combined repair of ulnar nonunion and conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty', 'Details': 'Wedge osteotomy of arthrodesis site, total elbow arthroplasty with Stryker distal humeral replacement system, bone graft from resected radial head for ulnar nonunion'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uncomplicated', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '4.5 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Achieving 0-110° elbow active flexion/extension, nearly full forearm rotation, minimal pain, happy with function of prosthesis'}}}"
"We present a case of a seventy-three-year-old Saudi man who has started visiting the primary health care center in our institution twenty-five years ago. He has been concerned with having a cancer that would give him only few days to live. At the beginning, the patient was evaluated medically through detailed history and documentation of his symptoms and then a management plan was created accordingly to exclude cancer. Full history, physical examinations, and radiological and pathological investigations were ordered and the results were all negative for cancer. The physician explained the results of the investigations to the patient but he refused them and continued to insist that he had cancer regardless of the results. The patient was then referred to Psychiatry Department to be evaluated but he could not realize that his symptoms might be of a nonorganic cause, either psychological or mental.\nThe patient continued to visit the general hospital, emergency department, and the primary health care in the institution and was still occupied with the idea of cancer presence. Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named. Moreover, this persistent occupation with this belief was disabling and limiting him from having a normal life and thought that his days were counted in this life. Also, a persistent refusal of any medical advice or explanation for his symptoms and fears was neither related to schizophrenia nor related to mood disorders.\nA diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder was made despite the patient's strong refusal. The family and social history evaluation also revealed a very low socioeconomic status and similar conditions in the family. Interestingly, two of the patient's daughters had similar reported conditions which could raise the suspicion of the possible genetic predisposition that could be triggered by shared environmental factors between him and his daughters. Following this extensive detailed history and evaluation, the treating psychiatrist contacted the department of medical eligibility to make the patient's file eligible again as promised by them with an unlimited eligibility to all specialties and primary care center. For the past twenty-five years of continuous hospital visiting, he has had almost weekly and even daily visits to the primary care. The patient kept complaining of variable symptoms every week and specifically asking for certain lab tests and radiological studies. Also, he successfully convinced some physicians to order a biopsy for him.\nIt is reported that physicians in the primary health care center used different techniques of counseling and they applied the biopsychosocial model to overcome the patient's fears but often failed to reach an achievement as the patient continued to complain of different symptoms and became a burden on the physician's clinic time and the hospital resources. It is also reported that the patient was extremely difficult to handle and convince. In the absence of institution guidelines to deal with such cases, all physicians tended to yield to the patient's persistent complaints and accepted his demands and fulfilled his desires by requesting whatever investigations the patient asked for. Over the years, the patient's investigations have cost approximately $178200 due to the system negligence to such cases. The patient's most requested investigations were mainly invasive radiological studies specifically abdomen and pelvis CT (18 times) and wide range of other invasive and noninvasive studies like chest CT (11 times), brain CT (7 times), chest MRI (4 times), lumbar spine MRI (6 times), and other studies. It is important here to put emphasis on the potential harms of radiation from radiological studies that are frequently requested by the patient in the absence of clear guidelines to be followed by practitioners for that group of patients. In addition, the patient asked for a variety of lab tests including renal profile, parathyroid hormone, complete blood count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, coronary risk profile, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, thyroid stimulating hormone, prostate specific antigen, free T4 level, and other very wide range of lab tests. Moreover, the patient underwent several biopsies like renal biopsy, prostate biopsy, gastric biopsy, and other different types of biopsies.\nThe patient was abusing the system in which resources and time were wasted. The patient kept overstepping each barrier by the hospital's staff to minimize his burden on the hospital by manipulating staff and deceiving and misleading them by giving incorrect information. Also, he was targeting junior practitioners and disturbing them and even threatened to sue the administration if restricted from health care. Five years ago, an experienced board-certified family physician was shocked when he looked at the patient's file and decided to put an effort to solve this problem by taking some actions. First action considered, after getting the approval from the family medicine department, was to limit the patient's primary care visits to only one clinic and to refer him to the supervising physician himself. Then, building strong and effective patient rapport based on trust and honesty was initiated. After negotiations, the patient agreed to enroll in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for six sessions ninety minutes each. The patient was advised to have a scheduled sleeping time, ensure healthy eating habits with regular physical exercise, be involved in social activities, stay away from stressors like searching web for symptoms, and avoid TV health shows and health magazines during active cycles of disorder. After that, there was an agreement with the patient not to disturb the clinic and he would get to see the physician regularly for checkups every three months.\nAfter five years of implementing the new rules, the patient is still visiting the clinic for regular follow-up and sometimes he breaks the rules and comes regularly to the clinic especially in active cycles of the disorder. On following the patient's condition in the last five years, it is noticed that there is a dramatic decrease in the total financial cost due to the relative decreasing number of visits, less time spent on arguing with the patient, and the filtration of his requests. Moreover, there is a remarkable improvement in the patient's condition because of CBT and relative compliance to health advice. We think that this rare case of extremely persisting illness anxiety is worth reporting because the patient managed somehow to escape attention and made a huge financial burden on hospital resources in the absence of clear guidelines in such conditions. Also, this case provides useful insight for future guidelines development.","{

"A 23-year-old female patient was admitted to a plastic surgery clinic because of an esthetic problem caused by swelling on the scalp, which started 1 year previously and gradually worsened in the most recent 6 months. She underwent surgery under local anesthesia without guidance using an imaging method. Bleeding started at the beginning of the operation, and the procedure was terminated. Five months after the first operation, she suffered from increased swelling of the lesion. She was seen by another physician, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed []. The physician felt that it was a simple skin lesion that could be completely removed under local anesthesia. She underwent a second surgery and experienced severe hemorrhaging. Later, she was referred to our clinic. Her physical examination revealed a painful mass lesion measuring 5 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm in the left parietal region at the vertex level. She did not have any complaints except for her esthetic problem. The results of her neurological examination were normal. A vascular malformation at the scalp was considered, and a cerebral MR angiography was performed and revealed a vascular mass lesion, which was located in the left parietal region and supplied by the branches of the left external carotid artery for which venous drainage could not be clearly identified []. Therefore, we performed a conventional cerebral angiography and detected AVM in the left parietal region that was supplied via the branches of the left temporalis superficial artery, left meningeal media artery, and right temporalis superficialis artery []. The lesion did not have an intracranial component and had no direct drainage vein into the dural sinuses. The patient was surgically treated under general anesthesia in the supine position, and her head was elevated at a 30° angle. The skin flap was removed with a horseshoe incision considering the vascularization of the scalp. The vascular lesion in the soft tissue was dissected, and the malformation was revealed. Initially, the supplying arteries of the lesion were closed. Later, the lesion was completely removed along with its nidus. The bone underlying the lesion had become thin; hence, the periosteum was cauterized with bipolar coagulation. Hemorrhaging from the bone was controlled with monopolar coagulation and bone wax. The skin flap was closed without the need for an additional plastic intervention. The histopathological diagnosis was as AVM [Figure –].","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Recurrent attacks of pain in both knees over 1 year', 'Severe pain over the medial aspect of the left knee for two weeks in September 2016', 'New onset of pain involving the lateral aspect of the left knee three months later', 'Gradual pain over the medial side of the right knee in April 2017'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': ['Fracture of the greater tuberosity of the left humerus', 'Undisplaced fracture of the left cuboid bone'], 'MedicalConditions': ['Mild asthma controlled with bronchodilator', 'Hypertension maintained on amlodipine 5 mg daily']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI of left knee', 'Finding': 'Moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema involving medial femoral condyle'}, {'Test': 'MRI of right knee', 'Finding': 'Moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema involving medial tibial plateau'}, {'Test': 'DXA scan', 'Finding': 'T score of -1.0 at lumbar spine and -1.6 at left femoral neck suggestive of osteopenia'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Recurrent knee pain', 'Type': 'Undetermined', 'Location': 'Medial and lateral aspects of both knees'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative management', 'Details': 'Oral vitamin D2 50,000 IU/week supplement, NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and use of cane for support'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Slow resolution of symptoms over a few weeks', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved mobility with pain management'}}}"
"A 32-year-old healthy female presented to a clinic (LS). The main complaint was severe pain in right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) region, right ear, mouth opening limitation, and asymmetrical of the face. The patient reported that she was born at full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery and no perinatal problems and no notable postnatal illness were reported. However, in the months following birth, the parents observed progressive enlargement of her right cheek and a differing eyelid width. According to the patient, the facial asymmetry had become more marked over the following years but had not increased in the past few years. No other family members were affected. Patient's mother reported a normal pregnancy. The enlargement extended from the midline to the preauricular region and inferiorly to the lower border of mandible []. The skin of the involved right side of the face was normal in appearance with no alteration in thickness. The extraoral examination revealed that the right side of the mandible was larger than the left side. The outer contour of the right ear was slightly larger and had a different shape compared to that of the left side []. The nose was normal with no deviation although the chin was deviated toward the side of her face. The lower lip on the right side was appeared thicker with drooping of the corner of the mouth on this side. The lips on the right side seemed very dry. The patient complained clicking in the left TMJ and disability in chewing and headache in the right side. Physical examination revealed normal symmetric body. The patient was mentally healthy. The mouth opening was 12 mm. On intraoral examination, asymmetry of the tongue was evident []. The right part of the tongue shows unilateral enlargement of fungiform papillae. The teeth size on the affected side appeared normal except the dimensions of maxillary right first molar, which was considerably greater than maxillary left first molar. The size of the lower right first molar was slightly greater than lower left first molar. The lower dental centerline was deviated to the right in relation to the midline and a downward canting of the occlusal plane was observed []. On occlusal examination, the central relation was unattainable. Furthermore, there was early contact in both central occlusion and right lateral movement. A discrepancy in range of mandibular motion was observed. The patient was referred for radiography. The radiographs confirmed the clinical findings. The panoramic radiograph [] showed that the right condyle, ramus, condylar neck, and the body of the mandible were enlarged. There was significant deposition of bone growth on the right mandible, and the bony trabeculation alteration was observed. The size of the right inferior dental canal was normal compared to the left mandibular canal and was displaced. Crowns and roots of the right mandibular molars were larger than the contralateral mandibular molars. The roots of the lower right first and second molars were remarkably divergent. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of the face and skull revealed that the zygomatic and frontal bones, right mastoid process, right half of the mandible and maxilla, maxillary sinus, and associated soft tissues were enlarged [Figure and ]. CBCT also demonstrated thickening the mucosal membrane of the right maxillary sinus [Figure and ]. There was no obstruction in the sinus meatus. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed no abnormalities [Figure and ]. 3D skull reconstruction CT image revealed hypertrophy of the right mandible, condyle, TMJ, zygomatic bone, petrous bone, and mastoid process []. The posteroanterior radiograph [] revealed enlargement of right half of the mandible, maxilla, and zygoma. The patient was referred to physician. Physician consultation reported systemic abnormality. Blood investigations were within normal limits. Depending on the clinical and radiographic abnormalities were thus consistent with the diagnosis of a hemifacial hypertrophy and fibrous hyperplasia. The patient was referred to oral surgeon. Surgical recontouring of right maxillary and mandibular bone was performed. After 6 months, condylectomy was performed for the right condyle; the size of the condyle was 5 cm × 3 cm []. The mouth opening was significantly increased to 4 cm.","{

"A 64-year-old Caucasian man from Austria was referred to the urological department because of episodes of intermittent gross hematuria. The patient had a colorectal carcinoma treated by rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy four years before. After radiotherapy ureteric strictures developed on both sides and ureteric stents were placed. At the time of admission the urine specimen showed few white and red blood cells and the urine culture was sterile. During the change of the ureteric stents a retrograde pyelography and cystoscopy were performed, showing a mild gross hematuria coming out of the right ureteric orifice but no further pathological findings. After the stent change, first the hematuria cleared but one day later again an episode of gross hematuria with blood clots in the bladder occurred. A transurethral catheter was placed and a multiphase CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed. CT detected no source of bleeding. The gross hematuria cleared again and an ureteroscopy on both ureteric sides were performed with special emphasis on the right ureter. Once again nothing suspicious could be found. Thereafter gross hematuria appeared again with massive hemorrhage and an arteriography was performed (). But once again no underlying reason for the bleeding could be found. Two days later a gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage occurred. The patient became hemodynamically unstable and needed blood transfusion of 6 U. Therefore, the indication for nephrectomy of the suspicious right side was set and performed. During the operation the ureteric stent was removed and at the end of the operation the hematuria stopped. When the patient left the operation room again a massive hemorrhage was identified within the bladder catheter. Again an arteriography was performed. Finally, the region of the fistula was identified at the distal common iliac artery and a stent graft was deployed across the fistula (). A postoperative angiogram showed complete closure of the fistula (). After adequate blood transfusion and fluid replacement the patient made a rapid and unremarkable recovery. Twelve months later the patient is still well and the stent graft remains patent. However, the patient lost his right kidney.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Inability to walk', 'Severe weakness and bone pain', 'History of osteomalacia'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Fracture of the pubic rami during delivery'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Nerve conduction study', 'Finding': 'Normal'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Osteomalacia', 'Type': 'Metabolic bone disease', 'Location': 'Systemic'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation', 'Details': 'Previously tried without improvement'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient became bedridden', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discontinued all treatments'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '7 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient remained bedridden with no improvement'}}}"
"The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it (). The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared (). From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears (). Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition []. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A [], the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination (). She survived without recurrence of disease for two years after the operation.","{

"A 60-year-old Kashmiri female presented to our department after having sustained a fracture of femur in the supracondylar region. After initial management, the fracture was fixed with a dynamic condylar screw assembly. After an uneventful postoperative period, the patient was discharged with advice to undergo supervised physiotherapy. 3 months into the postoperative period, the patient reported to our emergency department with pain in the thigh. X rays revealed a fracture above the dynamic condylar screw at the plate bone interface. The patient was admitted and revision surgery with a longer barrel plate performed. The patient followed up for a period of 4 months and was bearing weight when she again had pain in the peri implant area. Radiographs revealed a fracture of the femur at the new peri implant region. The patient's femoral neck radiograph revealed an osteoporosis grading of 3 according to Singh's classification []. Keeping in view the potential morbidity associated with the repeat plating we planned a method that would be less invasive and less destructive to the local fracture environment. The proposed surgery was explained to the patient and her attendants. The ethical board permission was sought and obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on a fracture table. The screws in the plate were removed percutaneously under image intensifier control to ensure the patency of intramedullary canal leaving the plate insitu to avoid reexposure of the bone surface. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a reamed antegrade intramedullary nail. Anticipating the difficulties in distal locking with an insitu plate an external locking device comprising of a distal full ring and a proximal Italian arch connected by two threaded rods were used. No blood transfusion, bone grafting were used and the mean operating time was 40 minutes. The patient was ambulated on the first post operative day and discharged from the hospital on the same day after advising range of motion exercises of the knee. The patient was advised to compress the fracture at a rate of 1 mm per day in divided increments. The follow up was done at two week intervals. At a mean follow up of 8 weeks when the signs of healing were seen on the radiographs the external ilizarov fixator was removed. The fracture united at 14 weeks with a mean range of motion of the ipsilateral Knee being 0 to 120 degrees. There were no complications associated with the procedure.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['24-day-old female baby with dyspnea and fever', 'Decreased air entry on the left side'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest radiograph', 'Finding': 'Consolidation of the left lung with air-filled bowel loops inside the chest'}, {'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Left-sided diaphragmatic defect with herniated large and small bowel and normal left kidney and adrenal gland'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Diaphragmatic hernia', 'Type': 'Congenital', 'Location': 'Thorax'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Diaphragmatic hernia repair using laparoscopy', 'Details': 'Reduction of herniated bowel and intrathoracic kidney, primary repair of diaphragmatic defect'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Day 5 postoperatively'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3 years postoperatively', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No evidence of recurrence or complications'}}}"
"A 47 year old gentleman presented to his general practitioner with acute onset lower back pain. The pain had commenced during coitus and radiated down the right leg. The initial diagnosis was of acute disc prolapse and he was referred for an urgent neurosurgical opinion. The neurosurgeon concurred that the pain may well have been of neurological origin and arranged an MRI scan. This was reported as showing no evidence of spinal cord pathology. The patient was reassured with the results of the MRI findings and was advised the pain was probably musculoskeletal in origin and should settle. Over the subsequent 6 weeks, the pain persisted and indeed increased in severity. The patient noted claudication-type pain in his right leg after approximately 100 metres. As the pain had not resolved after 6 weeks he revisited his general practitioner. During the subsequent examination the pulses in his right leg were noted to be absent and he was referred for an urgent vascular surgical opinion.\nThe patient was seen the following day in the vascular clinic where a history of severe acute claudication-type pain was noted in the right leg. There was a past medical history of marked hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which he took relevant medications, but none of angina, myocardial infarct or valvular heart disease. On clinical examination the heart rate was 68 beats per minute regular. The blood pressure in the right arm 130/70 mmHg was lower than that of the left arm 160/80. Cardiac examination was normal. There was no clinical evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the limbs revealed that the right lower limb pulses were all absent whilst those of the left leg were present and of good volume. An urgent abdominal ultrasound scan was arranged which demonstrated dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta and a subsequent CT scan (Figures , , ) confirmed that the dissection was a Type A dissection extending from the aortic valve down to the aortic bifurcation. A dissection flap was identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens were noted to have flow within them with the true lumen supplying the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery and right renal artery and the false lumen supplying the left renal artery and inferior mesenteric artery. Immediately below the inferior mesenteric artery the false lumen obliterated.\nAn immediate opinion was sought at the regional cardiothoracic unit and the patient was transferred urgently under their care. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the CT findings demonstrating turbulent flow in the ascending aorta suggestive of an intimal tear in the region although the lesion itself was not seen. The arch was mildly dilated but with no visible flap. Flow in the descending aorta was turbulent in the initial 2–3 cm suggesting intimal disruption.\nHe underwent operative repair of the thoracic dissection on the next available theatre list. The aortic valve was resuspended and the ascending aorta were replaced using an elephant trunk graft with reimplantation of the brachiocephalic artery on 1 patch and the left common carotid and subclavian arteries on a second patch.\nAfter 48 hours in the intensive care unit the patient was transferred to the ward where he made an uneventful recovery. Cardiac and cerebral functions were not impaired by the procedure as evidenced by return to preoperative state and no requirements for chronotropic medications.\nA routine postoperative CT scan demonstrated that the repair was satisfactory. There was thrombosis within the false lumen of the descending aorta but persistence of flow within both lumens of the abdominal aorta.","{

"A 68 year old male patient was admitted 48 hours after he suffered a severe hip injury when falling from a bridge. The initial Rx-ray at admission displayed a femoral neck fracture with dislocation of the femoral head into the pelvis (). The patient also presented macroscopic and laboratory confirmed hematuria. A CT scan was not available at that time, but because of the hematuria we suspected an anterior dislocation of the femoral head. A Foley catheter was introduced into the urinary balder and antibiotics were administrated. Surgery was performed next day in lateral approach of the hip with anterior capsulotomy. The femoral head was not found into the hip but in the pelvis and could not be extracted but only touched by finger through a laceration between the anterior acetabular rim and the decollated labrum, creating a dislocation space similar to the anterior dislocation or the shoulder. However a 50 mm Austin Moore prosthesis was implanted and after the surgery the patient had the femoral head replaced and the fractured femoral head retained as o loose fragment into the pelvis (). The patient was prepared for the next surgery and two days later the urologist extracted the femoral head by a new abdominal approach Gibson with retroperitoneal dissection of the common iliac vessels. The head was placed on the iliopsoas muscle and under the iliac common vessels, and during the procedure no visible injury of the ureter, balder or iliac vessels was found. Soon after removing the abdominal wound drainage the patient experienced pain in the hip, lost mobility and swelling occurred at the hip wound. Several punctures of the hip extracted a large amount of clear liquid which was investigated and was found to have density and elements like urine. A drainage tube was reinserted into the hip wound and the patient underwent repeated urological evaluation by urography and endoscopic techniques. A fistula injury of the ipsilateral ureter was found and an internal drainage of the ureter was introduced and left in situ for three months. The Moore prosthesis was extracted, the hip was debrided and irrigated with saline solution and gentamicin. The hip wound healed and the patient had a Girdlestone hip for about 5 months. The hip was revised with a total cemented Muller prosthesis, which resulted in a normal evolution of the wound and rehabilitation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Inability to walk on both lower limbs for 3 months', 'Sudden onset right groin pain while walking', 'Bilateral non-union of pathological fracture of femur neck'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd’s crook deformity of the proximal femur'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Sub-capita fracture of femur neck without avascular necrosis of femur head'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia', 'Type': 'Bone disorder', 'Location': 'Bilateral hips, left tibia'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Correction of deformity and fracture fixation', 'Details': 'Oblique and lateral closing wedge osteotomies on both sides, followed by fixation with Dynamic Richard’s screw and long side plate'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Full weight bearing without support at 18 months post-op', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient is walking full weight bearing without support'}}}"
"A 49 years old female presented with history of recurrent palpitations for last 10 years. During last year, she had 5 episodes of palpitations which required hospitalizations. The tachyardia was repeatedly terminated by intravenous adenosine and verapamil. She was nondiabetic and nonhypertensive. General physical and cardiovascular examination were normal. Her baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left bundle branch block with normal PR interval. The electrocardiogram of tachycardia revealed similar morphology, with the heart rate of 210 beats/min. (). Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not show any evidence of structural heart disease. An electrophysiological study was planned with a presumptive diagnosis of AVNRT. Catheter manipulation to obtain His bundle electrogram led to complete heart block because of trauma to right bundle that required temporary right ventricular pacing. No tachycardia could be induced during complete heart block and there was no evidence of accessory pathway. Complete heart block persisted for 3 hours during which she required temporary ventricular pacing support. Patient was discharged after 48 hours with a plan to restudy on recurrence. Within 15 days, she had 3 episode of tachycardia all terminated with intravenous adenosine. After the recurrence of episodes, she was taken up for a restudy with a plan of avoiding His bundle / Right bundle injury and as a part of the same plan to avoid His recording coronary sinus catheter was put from the right internal jugular vein. Three 7 F sheaths were put into right femoral vein and one 6F sheath was put into right internal jugular vein. One catheter was put into high right atrium and another into right ventricular apex carefully avoiding trauma to His bundle. From the internal jugular vein, since the catheter did not follow a normal course, angiogram was done that showed absent right superior vena cava and whole of the jugular system draining into hugely dilated coronary sinus which was missed on transthoracic echocardiogram (). At that point of time, when we found this venous anomaly the risk of ablation was again discussed with the family and the patient, explaining them the risk of development of complete heart block and need of permanent pacemaker which would be difficult in this patient. Deflectable catheter was then used to clearly define the upper and lower lip of coronary sinus to guide the ablation (). A 7F 4 mm tip steerable ablation catheter was positioned in right and left anterior oblique views. Tachycardia was induced and diagnosis of AVNRT was confirmed by standard protocol. The ablation was performed starting from the inferior lip of coronary sinus and gradually moving anteriorly towards the upper limb of coronary sinus. Intracardiac bipolar electrogram did not show any slow pathway potential near the coronary sinus ostium and at the site of successful ablation (). Just at the upper limb of coronary sinus good junctional rhythm was noted (). A complete lesion at 25-30 watts, temperature of 50ºC for 60 seconds was given. No VA or AV block was observed. Post ablation testing revealed absence of dual physiology and noninducable AVNRT. The patient was discharged on next day and till last follow up after 6 months she was asymptomatic.","{

"An 82-year-old female with 60 kg body weight and 156 cm height who was otherwise healthy underwent a right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis under epidural anesthesia at a hospital nearby. The insertion of the epidural catheter and operation were finished without any problems and the removal of the epidural catheter was attempted as usual two days after the operation. The epidural catheter broke during its removal. The physician felt resistance when he tried to pull out the catheter and then the catheter was broken 13 cm from the tip. X-rays and a computed tomography scan were subsequently taken (). Although the catheter fragment retaining within the patient was long, a wait-and-see approach was initially employed because there was no neurological deficit. The effusion from the drain hole stopped two days later. No neurological deficit or fever developed after the first evaluation of the images. However, the migration of the catheter was found by imaging studies four weeks after the occurrence of the catheter breakage (). After detailed discussions with the patient and her family it was decided that a surgical removal of the retained catheter should be performed. Then, the patient was referred to our hospital.\nThere was no neurological deficit at the time of admission. A laminectomy was performed at L2-3 seven weeks after the catheter had broken. The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia and then the spinal level that needed to be treated and the retained catheter were identified by using an image intensifier. We exposed the spinal process at L2-3 and the L2 spinal process was split by an air drill. The catheter was confirmed to be present between the L2 and L3 spinous processes and the edge of the catheter was found to be broken (). The catheter went entered the epidural space through the flavum.\nAfter removal of the bilateral flavum in an usual manner the catheter was found to be coiled up at the surface of the dura mater and was covered by a thin reactive film (). The catheter was heading to the nerve root. No evidence of dural puncture by the catheter was found. The removal of the catheter was first attempted by simple traction, however, was found to be impossible because of the adhesion (). The adhesion of the dura mater surface was carefully exfoliated and then the removal of the catheter was accomplished (). No cerebral spinal fluid leakage was found after removal of the catheter.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Concerned with having cancer despite negative test results', 'Continual visits to primary care center with variable symptoms'], 'MedicalHistory': {'DiagnosedIllness': 'Illness anxiety disorder'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiological and pathological investigations', 'Finding': 'Negative for cancer'}, {'Test': 'Thorough history and evaluation', 'Finding': 'Met criteria for illness anxiety disorder'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Illness anxiety disorder', 'Type': 'Mental health disorder', 'Location': 'N/A'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)', 'Details': 'Six sessions of ninety minutes each'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': ""Improvement in patient's condition"", 'DischargeStatus': 'Regular follow-up visits every three months'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Five years', 'FunctionalStatus': ""Dramatic decrease in total financial cost and improvement in patient's compliance""}}}"
"A 78 year old Caucasian male presented to our casualty 6 weeks following admission elsewhere with a history of swelling of the right leg and a pulmonary embolus. He had undergone VQ scanning with a proven diagnosis of pulmonary embolus and was therefore anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin.\nOn admission he had swelling of the right knee and lower thigh with loss of sensation on the dorsolateral aspect of the right foot. Clinical examination revealed a large mass in the right popliteal fossa. The initial diagnosis was that of deep venous thrombosis and imaging was undertaken and the patient referred for a vascular opinion.\nOn vascular review, the patient had a pulsatile mass comparable with a popliteal artery aneurysm of 12 cms diameter on the right and 6 cms on the left. His foot was warm and well perfused and his INR was 2.6. He underwent a duplex scan of the lower limb arteries which revealed ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta of 3.4 cms in diameter. A further CT arteriogram (fig , ) confirmed that in fact the swelling on the right side was indeed a pseudo aneurysm following rupture with peripheral calcification.\nThe dilemma was therefore a patient with an established pulmonary embolus and a friable clot in the iliac veins, anticoagulation and the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Due to lack of expertise we elected to continue with full anticoagulation rather than place an inferior vena caval filter. Operative exploration was performed through a medial approach under full anticoagulation and the right popliteal artery was found to contain a large volume of blood pointing laterally. The popliteal aneurysm was excluded. Duplex examination of the upper and lower limb veins revealed that the veins were of small diameter therefore revascularization of the leg was established by an inlay 8 mm PTFE graft. Due to continuous oozing, the aneurysm sac was packed and the end of the pack brought out laterally. The pack was removed at 48 hours under sedation. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Six weeks later he underwent repair of the left popliteal aneurysm.","{

"On the 24th April 2006 a 9 month old girl was brought to the Emergency Department of a hospital which routinely refers patients to us. She had sustained a dog bite to her face 30 minutes previously. She was seen by the emergency physicians and was found to have received multiple lacerations to her face over the right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek and over her left body of her mandible. She was fully examined and found to have no wounds elsewhere however due to the circumstances of patient and parental distress, intra-oral examination was not possible. The initial work up did not include radiographic investigations as it was felt by the emergency physicians that only a soft tissue injury was sustained. On the advice of the on-call maxillofacial team she had her facial wounds cleaned with aqueous iodine solution and she was started on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol. An examination by the ophthalmologist revealed no ocular injury.\nShe was transferred to our unit the following day, fasted in preparation for an examination under general anaesthesia and primary closure of her facial lacerations. During the procedure it was found that she had sustained an open fracture of her left mandible consistent with a dog bite. (fig ). This was treated via a trans-oral approach with a five hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws. (fig ). She had her facial laceration copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed in with a fine nylon suture. She was discharged home the next day. Seven days later she attended for removal of sutures under a general anaesthetic and examination of her jaw. The facial wounds were healing well and there was no movement at the fracture site. Ten weeks after the first operation she was admitted for removal of her mandibular plate under general anaesthetic. There was good bony union and the plate was removed with no complications (fig ). She will continue to be reviewed in clinic to monitor dentoalveolar development and mandibular growth.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Esthetic problem caused by swelling on the scalp'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Cerebral MRI', 'Finding': 'Vascular mass lesion in the left parietal region'}, {'Test': 'Cerebral MR angiography', 'Finding': 'AVM in the left parietal region'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)', 'Type': 'Vascular malformation', 'Location': 'Left parietal region at the vertex level'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical removal of AVM', 'Details': 'Closure of supplying arteries, complete removal of lesion, cauterization of periosteum, control of hemorrhaging'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Esthetic problem resolved'}}}"
"We present a 58 year old male with an unusual posterior thigh mass for more than a year. Patient had a past medical history significant for RCC, initially diagnosed at stage II, 11 years ago followed by left nephrectomy. Patient also had metastasis to tail of the pancreas and tip of spleen 6 years ago which was followed by total resection of pancreas and spleen. Patient was followed up for RCC and was last seen 2 years ago when his PET/CT showed slightly increased hypermetabolic area in the biceps femoris muscle which was interpreted as a muscle injury secondary to the rarity of the metastasis to the skeletal muscle from RCC. Patient during the current follow up visit developed a large mass in the posterior side of the thigh which was present for more than a year. As per patient, the mass initially was diagnosed as a blood clot on venous doppler, for which he was treated by his primary care physician with warfarin for more than 6 months. However, the mass progressively increased in size. Patient did not mention of any other constitutional symptoms. On physical examination, a painless, tense mass along the length of biceps femoris muscle measuring more than 25 cm was found in the posterior aspect of the left thigh. The mass was hypervascular and numerous varicosities of different sizes were noticeable on the surface. Patient was imaged using FDG-PET/CT which showed hypermetabolic activity with an uptake value of 3.8 to 4.1 in biceps femoris muscle with multiple serpiginous vessels throughout the tumor, in accordance with a large cavernous hemangioma or an angiosarcoma. This was followed by MRI to better understand the morphology of the tumor, demonstrating a mesenchymal component in an encapsulated mass, raising the possibility of a liposarcoma or an angiosarcoma. A core tissue biopsy was done which demonstrated well defined adipose tissue but because of high suspicion for malignancy, patient underwent preembolization followed by surgical resection. A 28 x 17 x 7 cm resected mass was determined to be metastasis from his primary RCC (Figures , , , , and ).\nPatient on his follow up with a whole body FDG-PET/CT was also found to have metastasis to his lateral ventricle in the brain from the RCC.","{

"Our patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian female with medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She had been treated for invasive ductal breast cancer 7 years ago with lumpectomy of the left breast and axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy and seven cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to her postoperatively, and Anastrozole was prescribed to her for 5 years. She underwent regular annual follow-up for 5 years with chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease. Seven years after the initial treatment for breast cancer, abdominal CT revealed a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII measuring 7 cm in diameter as well as a 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas (, left). Tumor markers AFP, CA 15–3, CA 19–9, and CEA were all within normal limits and the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of abdominal mass apart from mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region. Moreover, biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.\nSubsequently the patient went through oncologic consultation, and both lesions were considered to be resectable, although controversy arose whether they were metastatic or second primary malignancies. CT-guided percutaneous biopsies or laparoscopic biopsies were proposed as minimal invasive methods of diagnosis. The patient rejected both of them due to the risk for possible complications and cancer spillage and decided to undergo laparotomy, open rapid biopsy, and excision of the lesions in one procedure. After accessing the peritoneal cavity through an extended right subcostal incision, we performed hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe. A solid mass was recognized at hepatic segments VI and VII and rapid biopsy was taken which showed primary HCC. Moreover, after entering the lesser sac, a second rapid biopsy was taken from the lesion at the pancreatic tail which showed chronic fibrosis without elements of malignancy (). We decided to perform resection of hepatic segments VI and VII since intraoperative hepatic ultrasound also confirmed that the mass was resectable with safe oncologic margins. Hepatic segmentectomy was achieved using a microwave tissue coagulator to mark and coagulate the margins of hepatectomy and ultrasound harmonic scalpel to transect the hepatic parenchyma with a minimal blood loss of 40 cc (). Moreover, argon beam coagulator and fibrin glue were used to seal the raw liver surface and prophylactic cholecystectomy was also performed. Finally, the pancreatic lesion was left intact since malignancy was not confirmed with rapid biopsy.\nPathology report described a hepatic mass with maximum diameter of 6.5 cm which consisted of malignant cells with mild to severe atypia and low to medium mitotic rate. Immunohistochemistry showed that cancer cells highly expressed keratins 8/18, Hep-Par 1 and AFP and did not express keratin 7 and GATA-3 (). Endothelial cells within the mass were positive for CD 34. The gallbladder along with the cystic lymph node was normal. The final diagnosis was low-grade HCC with liver margins widely free from malignant infiltration.–\nThe postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. The subdiaphragmatic and subhepatic drains were removed on the third postoperative day without signs of hemorrhage or bile leakage and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Follow-up abdominal CT scanning on the first and sixth month after the operation showed subcapsular hepatic fluid collection without recurrence of the HCC (, right).

He had initially developed sudden weakness and difficulty using his right upper extremity at the age of 16 years. He eventually had to learn to write using his left hand because of the severity of his weakness. His symptoms progressed over several years, eventually developing into severe symmetrical upper extremity weakness and atrophy in his distal muscles. His lower extremities were spared. Our patient stated he was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy in the US when he was 25 years old. After receiving this diagnosis, he subsequently had a muscle biopsy in Mexico that reportedly confirmed his diagnosis. He had no family members with muscular dystrophy or any other neuromuscular conditions. His symptoms reached their plateau at this time. Because of the stability of his symptoms and his understanding of the disease course, our patient did not seek any further medical care for over 20 years. Upon returning to the US, he was seen by a primary care physician and referred for neurological examination to establish care as well as evaluate the worsening of previously stable chronic symptoms.\nOn presentation, our patient reported a few months of clinical deterioration, particularly recent left upper arm intermittent mild pressure pain. Our patient grew concerned when he noticed increased difficulty performing fine motor tasks with his left hand. In addition, he was experiencing recurrent intermittent episodes of dysphagia while eating solid foods. Our patient denied ever having any previous bulbar symptoms prior to his recent clinical deterioration.\nA clinical examination demonstrated that our patient was thin with significant bilateral upper extremity muscle atrophy and associated weakness. He had severe asymmetric focal segmental atrophy of his bilateral forearm flexor and extensor muscle groups, with preserved and prominent bilateral brachioradialis muscles (Figure ). He had corresponding severe weakness in his upper extremities as measured using the Medical Research Council Scale, with 4-/5 to 5/5 proximal strength and as low as 1/5 strength in his distal muscles. He had bilateral radial deviation during wrist extension. Although his lower extremities demonstrated normal bulk, he had mild weakness on manual muscle testing as well. Our patient had 4/5 strength in his left hip extensors and flexors as well as 4/5 strength in bilateral knee extensors. He had no face weakness, no sensory deficits, no abnormal reflexes, no muscle fasciculations, and no upper motor neuron signs on examination.\nCompound muscle action potentials (CMAP) of his left median, ulnar and radial nerves were absent. His upper extremity sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) responses were normal except for a slightly low amplitude of his ulnar and radial nerves. His lower extremity peroneal and tibial CMAPs and sural SNAPs were normal. Electromyography (EMG) of his upper extremities demonstrated evidence of diffuse chronic neurogenic changes in C5 to T1 innervated muscles as well as evidence of active denervation in his right triceps brachii. In his left lower extremity, chronic neurogenic changes were noted in the gastrocnemius medial head. His left cervical paraspinal muscles were normal on EMG.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast of his cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord demonstrated Chiari malformation type I with associated syringohydromyelia extending from C1 (Figure ) to T11 (Figure ). The maximal anterior-posterior diameter was 4mm and maximal lateral diameter 10mm. There was cord atrophy and mild atrophy of his paraspinal musculature (Figure ). Once the syrinx was identified on MRI, our patient was referred to our neurosurgery team for evaluation. An MRI of his brain with and without contrast provided additional views of the Chiari malformation type I (Figure ).","{

"A 74 year-old Caucasian woman with complete heart block had dual chamber pacemaker implanted in 1990. Her initial system included a Medtronic 4504 passive fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4004 passive fixation ventricular lead. She subsequently underwent replacement of her pulse generator in 1998 and insertion of a new Medtronic 5568 active fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4068 ventricular leads in August 2003 due to lead failure. She underwent a subsequent generator change in June 2011. The original atrial and ventricular leads were abandoned when the new leads were added in 2003. All procedures had been undertaken at a referring institution and she had not had any prior open-heart surgical procedures. The patient presented at her home hospital with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket in February 2014. Blood cultures did not grow any bacterial or fungal organisms. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram was performed to assess for vegetations on the leads. No vegetations were identified, but there was suspicion that one her atrial lead was extravascular. She underwent chest computerized tomographic imaging and this study revealed that one of her right atrial lead tips was approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space (Figure ). The patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone based on a diagnosis of suspected pacemaker pocket infection. She underwent pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement, but extraction was not undertaken due to the increased risks involved with the lead being extra-vascular. No organism was identified from samples of fluid cultured during that initial debridement procedure. Despite that debridement procedure and prolonged antibiotics there was clinical recurrence of the infection and the patient was subsequently transferred to our center for complex lead extraction.\nTo minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade given the chronic right atrial lead perforation, a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was undertaken. Using a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support if necessary, midline sternotomy was performed. Dense adhesions were found within the pericardial space consistent with likely prior pericarditis. Given the location of the RA lead, care was taken to leave the right atrial dissection until all other vascular structures were exposed. With uneventful dissection of the right atrium, direct visualization of the protruding passive fixation lead was obtained (Figure ). To avoid the risks associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and given the good visualization of the perforating atria lead, an off-pump technique was considered using a “lead-inverting stitch”. To achieve hemostatic control over the region of the atrial wall where the lead exited, a purse-string stitch was placed circumferentially around the lead tip using 3–0 prolene with multiple pledgets (Figure A). The externalized tip of the perforating atrial lead was then mobilized by cutting a rim of surrounding atrial tissue. This allowed the end of the lead to be dunked within the right atrial chamber while the purse-string suture was tightened for hemostasis (Figure B and C). With this “lead inverting stitch”, the lead was free within the right atrium and could now be safely extracted using transvenous laser extraction techniques.\nWith the heart partially verticalized, the lateral wall of the left ventricle was exposed and an epicardial lead (Medtronic 4968) was placed. It was then tunnelled through the subcutaneous tissue above the rectus sheath, secured and connected to the new pacemaker. The new pacemaker was then placed in a newly created pocket, below the left costal margin. The sternotomy wound was covered with sterile surgical towels.\nThe infected pacemaker pocket was then opened and direct visualization confirmed the presence of a small amount of murky fluid. This fluid was sent for culture. The pocket was then extensively debrided and the four transvenous pacemaker leads were prepared for complex extraction in a standard manner beginning with retraction of the distal screw to facilitate separation of the active fixation lead tip from the myocardium interface during laser extraction. A purse string suture was subsequently positioned along the pectoral muscle around each lead at its insertion site to avoid any significant bleeding when the leads are completely removed. The lumen of each lead was then probed for patency with a standard stylet to ensure that a lead-locking-stylet can be utilized and advanced deep into the lead lumen for adequate gripping during the extraction process. Appropriate sizing of each lumen and distal delivery of the locking stylets was subsequently performed. A long silk suture thread was then tied to the outside of the lead near its insertion site, extended along the length of the lead, and tied to its end to provide further support along with the lead-locking-stylet when applying traction on the lead during laser extraction. Now that the leads have been prepared, transvenous lead extraction with a #14 French laser sheath was attempted. Due to the presence of multiple biding sites, up-sizing to a #16 laser sheath was required along with the use of a less compliant outer sheath (Visi-sheath). All the leads were removed entirely, with the perforating atrial lead removed last. There was no hemodynamic compromise throughout the procedure and no mechanical complications related to the procedure. The “lead inverting stitch” retained its integrity and hemostasis was preserved throughout the transvenous lead extraction.\nFollowing successful lead extraction, the median sternotomy and old pacemaker pocket incisions were closed in a standard fashion and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for post-operative monitoring. The total procedure time from incision to wound closure was 5 hours and 24 minutes. Post-operative course was complicated with hypoxia secondary to atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia that resolved after 5 days. The patient was discharged back to her home hospital for ongoing rehabilitation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Intermittent gross hematuria'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Colorectal carcinoma treated with rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Urine specimen', 'Finding': 'Few white and red blood cells, sterile culture'}, {'Test': 'CT scan of abdomen and pelvis', 'Finding': 'No source of bleeding detected'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Ureteric fistula', 'Type': 'Complication of previous treatment', 'Location': 'Distal common iliac artery'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Nephrectomy of right kidney and stent graft deployment', 'Details': 'Removal of ureteric stent, closure of fistula with stent graft'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Rapid and unremarkable', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Twelve months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient remains well, stent graft remains patent'}}}"
"We report the case of a 59-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, both of which were being treated by his primary physician. The patient suffered a traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013 owing to a fall and underwent surgery. Computed tomography (CT) scans performed at the time were focused on the lumbar spine, so other organs were barely included in the image range and no contrast medium was used. However, when carefully observed retrospectively, the CT scan showed a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta, suggesting a localized dissection of the abdominal aorta (). However, there was no mention of localized aortic dissection, because the dissection was fairly localized and did not show any abnormal findings, such as aneurysm formation. In addition, the adventitia causing the aortic dissection was also calcified. The findings suggested a chronic aortic dissection that occurred even before the trauma, rather than an acute aortic dissection that occurred at the time of the trauma.\nIn March 2020, the patient was admitted to the emergency department of a nearby general hospital for vomiting. He had no abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis and prescribed oral medication. On physical examination, palpation of the abdomen revealed a pulsating mass, and the patient subsequently consulted his family doctor. After abdominal ultrasound examination, the patient's doctor diagnosed him with an AAA. He subsequently referred the patient to another hospital for a contrast CT scan and a full workup of the AAA. After the enhanced CT scan, the patient was referred to our hospital, where we determined that urgent treatment was necessary owing to the irregular nature of the aneurysm.\nAlthough he did not have any findings suggestive of an infectious disease such as fever or pain, we first considered the possibility of an infectious aortic aneurysm because it was an irregular aneurysm. Upon examination, a pulsating abdominal mass was found, but without tenderness at the site. We conducted a screening test to locate the source of infection. Furthermore, a blood culture was performed, and the results were negative. An oral examination was performed considering the possibility that the oral infection had spread to the aorta and become an infectious aortic aneurysm. Multiple cavities and loose teeth were noted. Although not deemed to be a source of infection, the teeth were extracted, and the patient was prescribed an antibacterial to prevent future exacerbation. To rule out other infections, further laboratory work included a complete blood count, renal function, liver function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and IgG-4, all of which were found to be within normal limits.\nA CT scan revealed an irregular AAA with a maximum short diameter of 36 mm within the infrarenal aorta (). Furthermore, part of the abdominal aortic intima calcifications were displaced inward, suggesting aortic dissection.\nA laparotomy was performed by midline abdominal incision. There was no thickening of the arterial wall or retroperitoneal adhesions, as found in inflammatory aneurysms; however, part of the abdominal aneurysm wall was firmly adhered to the surrounding tissue. When the aorta was cross-clamped below the renal artery and the aneurysm was cut open, a partial defect in the intima was observed at the point where CT findings had suggested an aortic dissection. The inside of the false lumen was filled with a dark red thrombus, and a partly organized thrombus was also observed. The aorta was trimmed below the renal artery, and a Y graft replacement (J graft 16 × 8 mm) was performed. The distal side was anastomosed to the common iliac artery on both sides.\nPathologic examination revealed that the medial elastic fibers of the aorta were thin. A vascular lumen was formed by fibrous tissue outside the medial elastic fiber of the aorta. Infiltrating inflammatory cells and macrophages that phagocytosed hemosiderin were found in the surrounding area and wall structure. No elastic fibers were found on the wall of the vessel lumen (). From these observations, it was judged that the vascular cavity was formed owing to the collapse of the wall structure of the aortic aneurysm.\nNo bacteria were detected in the thrombus culture obtained during surgery. One week after surgery, a CT scan confirmed that there were no further complications, and the patient was discharged 8 days postoperatively.","{

"A 5-year-old female patient visited the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with a complaint of pain in the region of the right posterior teeth of the lower jaw. Her mother also reported that her daughter had shown an asymptomatic swelling on the right side of her face since birth. The patient had undergone examination of this condition at 8 months of age. There was history of a gradual increase in the extent of the swelling with age, and the asymmetry of the face persisted. The child was born at full term with normal delivery and there was no history of consanguineous marriage in the family. The child was of normal build and intelligence. There was no familial history of such complaints in the family and serum chemistry revealed no abnormalities.\nThe swelling over the face extended from the zygomatic arch up to the lower border of the mandible on the right side. It was diffuse and had a sponge-like consistency. It was large enough to cause obliteration of the nasolabial fold and the right corner of the mouth seemed to be drooping. No other physical abnormality was noted ().\nIntraoral examination revealed that the cause of pain was the carious right mandibular deciduous second molar. It was also noticed that premature eruption of the permanent mandibular incisors and first molar, and of the maxillary molar was found on the right side. The tongue was also hypertrophic on the right side with noticeably enlarged papillae. The buccal mucosa and gingiva appeared normal ().\nPanoramic radiograph showed that the right mandibular body and ramus were asymmetrically large in size. There was accelerated development of the maxilla and mandible on the right with advanced eruption of the teeth as compared to the left. Radiographic analysis also revealed that all of the teeth on the right side had accelerated root formation relative to their counterparts on the left side. The condyle and the coronoid process on the right side were large with a prominent sigmoid notch. Multiple carious teeth were also noted ().\nMRI examination revealed the presence of a diffuse lipomatous tissue (which appeared bright or hyperintense on T1 weighted images) in the right cheek region and the region of the pterygomandibular space. There was fatty infiltration in the tissues anterior to the wall of the maxillary sinus and adjacent to the mandible on the right side. Other features of asymmetric enlargement of the right side of the face were also noted ().\nAxial and coronal CT scan sections showed a large markedly hypodense well defined mass causing severe swelling of the right cheek. The lesion extended from the infratemporal fossa superiorly to the lower border of the mandible inferiorly. The interior of the lesion had multiple enhancing hyperdense septae; however, the lesion itself did not appear to be enhanced after contrast administration. The right side of the mandible, coronoid process and condyle, maxillary sinus, and pterygoid plates including the masseter and the base of the skull were larger than the left side structures ( and ).\nThe CT and MRI findings were suggestive of a benign soft tissue mass of fat like density with enlargement of the mandible and base of the skull on the right side suggestive of a developmental anomaly. The infiltration of diffuse fatty tissue around the mandible is suggestive of lipomatosis like lesion in association with hemifacial hyperplasia.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Acute abdominal pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No history of blunt abdominal trauma'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Enhanced abdominal CT', 'Finding': '5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it'}, {'Test': 'CT at our hospital', 'Finding': '4 cm diameter cystic tumor protruding from pancreatic tail, distant from main pancreatic duct'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Pancreas'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Laparoscopic enucleation', 'Details': 'Performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum, with division of pancreatic parenchyma using laparoscopic coagulating shears'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Two years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Survived without recurrence of disease'}}}"
"The 30-year-old, gravidity 3, parity 2 patient had no medical problems during her pregnancy follow-up visits, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, and premature delivery. The patient had given birth to a baby weighing 3500 grams via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation and she experienced heavy bleeding at day 6 after birth. The patient did not respond to medical therapies and conventional methods and underwent hysterectomy due to impaired hemodynamics caused by uncontrolled bleeding. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with full recovery. The patient experienced active vaginal bleeding on postoperative day 10 and underwent cuff repair through the vaginal route after exploration. Possible bleeding foci that were inspected during exploration were sutured and then the patient was discharged with full recovery. However, the patient experienced recurrent abundant bleeding on postoperative day 20 for which she was hospitalized and underwent bilateral hypogastric artery ligation. The patient experienced another episode of abundant bleeding on day 7 after the hypogastric artery ligation and she was then referred to our clinic. The patient’s hemodynamics was stable on initial examination. Laboratory parameters were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed normal ovaries and no fluid in the abdominal cavity. A vaginal examination revealed no bleeding. The patient experienced heavy bleeding on day 3 after admission to our clinic and she also had impairment in her hemodynamics. Her hemoglobin was 4.8 g/dL and the patient was administered 4 units of erythrocyte suspension. The patient underwent emergency surgery, but no active bleeding focus was detected. A consultation with a radiologist was performed because no bleeding focus was detected intraoperatively, and the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement. The CT scans showed findings suggestive of aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area (). The patient had ongoing bleeding and she underwent angiography in the interventional radiology clinic. Initial angiography revealed an arteriovenous fistula and aneurysm filling from the right internal iliac artery (). The artery fistula was closed with a coil. The right internal iliac artery was totally obstructed by the coil, causing intermittent bleeding after partial intraoperative ligation. On the second day after the intervention, the patient still had bleeding, although the amount had decreased. The patient was re-evaluated by interventional radiologists; the branches of the left uterine artery were angiographically obstructed with microparticles and the partially-ligated left internal iliac artery was totally closed by coils (). The patient received 15 units of erythrocyte suspension until the completion of the second procedure. The patient became hemodynamically stable following the procedure and had no recurrent bleeding during the follow-up period; she was discharged with full recovery on postoperative day 15.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient.","{

"Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, as the patient had come from a remote rural area and could not accept such a treatment due to the prohibitive cost, she was transferred to the surgical clinic, where the most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction.\nThe postoperative examination four months later revealed that the bone contours had returned to normal, the asymmetry of the face had disappeared, and the cortical bone thickness had decreased and been remodeled to the previous normal appearance (Figures and ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Fracture of femur in the supracondylar region', 'Pain in the thigh post-surgery', 'Fracture of the femur at the new peri-implant region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Fracture of the 9th right rib'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Fracture above the dynamic condylar screw at the plate bone interface'}, {'Test': 'Radiograph', 'Finding': ""Osteoporosis grading of 3 according to Singh's classification""}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Femoral fracture', 'Type': 'Peri-implant fracture', 'Location': 'Supracondylar region of femur'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Antegrade intramedullary nailing with external locking device', 'Details': 'Removal of screws in the plate, reduction of fracture, fixation with intramedullary nail, and external locking device'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No complications, fracture united at 14 weeks', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on first postoperative day'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '8 weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Range of motion of ipsilateral Knee: 0 to 120 degrees'}}}"
"This 56 years old lady who has been known to the local mental health services for the past 20 years with symptoms of depression and anxiety was attending follow up appointments on and off. For her current episode she was in contact with the local team for the last few years and had presented with moderate to severe depression that needed regular follow up and review of her medication. She also had two inpatient hospital admissions to the psychiatric unit after attempting suicide on two occasions during this episode. During her latest admission, she was treated with different antidepressants and anxiolytics but without any major benefit. Because of the poor control of symptoms of depression, Lamotrigine was added to her other medications (Sertaline and Buspirone which she had been taking for many months). She was started on lamotrigine 25 mg daily which was gradually increased to 50 mg twice daily over the next 2 weeks. Her anxiety and depressive symptoms showed significant improvement on this combination and she started feeling almost back to her normal self. She was continued on this treatment & was discharged from the psychiatric inpatient unit on a combination of Lamotrigine 50mg twice a day, Sertaline 150 mg daily and Buspirone 5mg twice daily. At her weekly follow up, she continued showing improvement in her mental state and the treating team was very satisfied with her response to treatment.\nAbout 16 days following hospital discharge she developed conjunctivitis and over the next 3-4 days, developed swelling of the face and lips. She also developed erosion of the mucous membrane inside her mouth & erythematous papules and bullous eruptions over her body that were particularly bad on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet where she developed detachment of the epidermis. In view of her increasing symptoms, she had to be referred to the general hospital on the 4th day after developing these side effects. She was admitted for further treatment. She had to be treated in the Intensive Care Unit as her physical symptoms deteriorated over the next few days. All her routine blood tests were normal except C-Reactive Protein which was high. She was kept under the care of a medical specialist, ophthalmologist and dermatologist who agreed with the clinical diagnosis of Stevens - Johnson Syndrome. Lamotrigine, along with her other antidepressant medications was stopped. After a few days she started feeling better, made a full recovery in 2 weeks time and was discharged home. Her ophthalmic symptoms needed a few more weeks for full recovery.","{

"A 42-year-old woman applied to the ophthalmology department with a complaint and history of a half-hour-long visual loss of her left eye one day ago. At clinical examination, both of her eyes were found to have full vision, and also microscopic fundus examinations revealed no pathological conditions. The patient gave a history of a prior application to an outer medical center with the same complaint, and there she had been diagnosed with a left ICA occlusion, following Doppler US and angiographic examinations. The patient applied to our department with the demand of an extracranial carotid Doppler US examination. At Doppler US, the right CCA diameter was found to be 8 mm, whereas the left one came out to be 4 mm (Figures and ). The right CCA bifurcation and the ICA and ECA were found to be normal. At the left side, spectral data for the ECA () and the particular branching which demonstrates that the vessel is ECA indeed were present, whereas there was no Doppler signal and gray-scale findings for the ICA (). Because the left CCA was hypoplastic and there were no findings of atherosclerotic plaques in other arterial segments; it was thought that the left ICA might not be suffering an occlusion at all, but instead it might well be agenetic. Based on the presumption of an ICA agenesis, a computed tomographic (CT) examination of the skull base was performed. CT images revealed a normally appearing right carotid canal but no clear image of the left one (). Then, the previous angiographic images of the patient were reevaluated, and it was then recognized that the left ECA and its branches were well visible, while the left ICA and its branches did not show any filling with contrast (). It was also noted that the filling of the left anterior and medial cerebral arteries was sustained by the patent anterior communicating artery following the injection of contrast into the right carotid artery () and also via the posterior communicating artery following the injection of the vertebrobasilary system (). In addition to the ICA agenesis, another surprising finding was that the right vertebral artery was not stemming from the right subclavian artery but instead was originating from the aortic arch, as its first branch (). It was finally understood that the patient did not have an occlusion of the left ICA, but instead her left ICA was agenetic. She also had an additional aortic arch anomaly. At the end, it was concluded that an ipsilateral CCA hypoplasia might be taken as a valuable clue in the differential diagnosis of ICA agenesis and occlusion.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Acute onset lower back pain radiating down the right leg', 'Persistent pain worsening over 6 weeks, claudication-type pain in right leg'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': 'Marked hypertension', 'Hyperlipidaemia': 'History of hyperlipidaemia'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'No evidence of spinal cord pathology'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Type A dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Type A aortic dissection', 'Type': 'Vascular condition', 'Location': 'Intra-abdominal aorta, ascending and descending aorta'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Operative repair of thoracic dissection', 'Details': 'Replacement of ascending aorta with elephant trunk graft'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '48 hours in ICU, routine postoperative CT scan', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No impairment in cardiac and cerebral functions'}}}"
"A 39 year-old white female presented to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital with worsening pain of the left breast and left chest wall region and a recurrent palpable mass within the inferior aspect of her left breast. She reports having had three separate left breast biopsies in the past (seven years, four years, and one year prior to her current presentation) for a recurring left breast palpable mass in this same location.\nSeven years prior to her current presentation, she presented to an outside community hospital with a palpable left breast mass in the inferior lateral aspect of her left breast. She underwent a left breast biopsy at that time that was reported as showing dense fibrous stroma with fibrocystic changes.\nThree years later (four years prior to her current presentation), she noticed a recurrent enlarging palpable left breast mass. She underwent a repeat left breast biopsy by the same surgeon and this showed hyperplastic fibrosis, consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. The pathology report clearly stated that the tumor involved the surgical margins. The patient reports that the surgeon told her that this was a benign tumor and that nothing further needed to be done.\nThree additional years later (one year prior to her current presentation), she again noticed a recurrent enlarging palpable left breast mass. She again underwent a repeat left breast biopsy by the same surgeon and this again showed findings consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. Again, the pathology report clearly stated that the tumor involved the surgical margins. The patient reports that the surgeon again told her that this was a benign tumor and that nothing further needed to be done.\nSince the time of her last left breast biopsy (one year prior to her current presentation), the patient reports persistent and worsening pain and palpable tenderness within the inferior aspect of her left breast and left chest wall region, with an associated increasing sized palpable mass within the same region.\nUpon presentation to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital, she was found on clinical examination to have volume loss along the entire inferior aspect of her left breast and slight downward tilting of her left nipple and areolar complex. She had three separate well-healed surgical scars along the inferior-lateral aspect of her left inframammary fold (Figure ). Underneath these scars, she had a firm palpable mass, clinically measuring 6.5 × 3.0 × 2.5 cm in size and which clinically appeared to be adherent to the underlying left chest wall structures. She had no clinically apparent adenopathy in her left axilla.\nA mammogram showed scarring and tissue disorganization in the inferior left breast from prior multiple biopsies, but appeared unchanged since a prior mammogram done 13 months previously at an outside community hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left breast showed an intensely enhancing lesion in the inferior-lateral aspect of the left breast, measuring 5.0 × 1.7 cm in size (Figure and ). This lesion appeared to abut the underlying chest wall musculature and appeared to efface the underlying fat plane. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed a 5.2 × 1.6 cm mass within the inferior-lateral aspect of the left chest wall that appeared to be in continuity with the left pectoralis major muscle and left serratus anterior muscle (Figure ). A core biopsy was performed to the palpable left breast mass that confirmed the diagnosis of fibromatosis.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room at to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and underwent a left total mastectomy, with en bloc resection of the underlying musculature (inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) and en bloc resection of the underlying chest wall structures (fourth, fifth, and six ribs, intercostals muscles, and parietal pleura). The left chest wall defect (Figure ) was then closed with a 2-mm DualMesh Gore-Tex patch (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, Arizona). The remaining portions of the left pectoralis major muscle was dissected off the underlying left chest wall and its lateral most attachments to the left humerus and superior attachments to the clavicle were divided, allowing it to rotate inferiorly to completely cover the Gore-Tex patch. The left mastectomy site was then closed in the standard fashion. No attempts at cosmetic breast reconstruction with autologous tissue transfer or expander/implant placement were considered at that time. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged to home on post-operative day eight.\nGross pathologic evaluation of the specimen, which overall measured 14.5 × 13.3 × 6.4 cm in size, revealed a 5.2 cm tumor that was grossly invading the underlying attached skeletal muscle to a depth of about 1.2 cm (Figure ). It could not be definitively determined whether the invasion of the underlying skeletal muscle involved only the superficial muscles resected (consisting of the inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) or whether skeletal muscle invasion was to the level of the underlying intercostal muscles resected. However, both grossly and microscopically, there was no evidence of invasion into the bony ribs or underlying parietal pleura. Microscopic evaluation revealed a proliferation of relatively evenly spaced plump spindle cells arranged in intersecting fascicles and associated with mild to moderate amounts of collagen and occasional mitotic figures (Figure ) and demonstrated that the spindle cell proliferations invaded into the adjacent skeletal muscle (Figure ). All surgical margins were negative. On immunohistochemical staining, the spindle cells were negative for S-100 protein, muscle actin (HHF-35), and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. On immunohistochemical staining, less than 5% of the spindle cells were positive for Mib1 (Ki-67). The histology and immunohistochemical staining supported a diagnosis of fibromatosis (desmoid tumor).\nThe patient is now 22 months out from her previous aggressive operative management of her previous multiple recurrences of her fibromatosis of her left breast and she remains disease free.","{

"A 66-year-old man presented to emergency department with an anterior shoulder dislocation () after a ski fall without loss of consciousness. At the initial management, the patient did not show any neurological dysfunction or pulse deficit. The first reduction attempts were unsuccessful and the patient was put under general anesthesia before trying again. During the new attempt to reduce the shoulder dislocation, we observed the occurrence of a hematoma in the deltopectoral region (). At the same time, loss of palpable peripheral pulse and upper limb ischemia appeared. A CT scan was performed and showed a compressive hematoma in the axillary region, a disruption of the axillary artery flow, and a bilateral pulmonary embolism (previously unknown). The patient was transferred to a university hospital to be supported by vascular and trauma surgeons. The patient was still under general anesthesia. The dislocation was successfully reduced in the operating room. Upper limb ischemia with persistent pulseless and cold arm led to an emergency vascular management. The humeral artery was dissected through the brachial tunnel and a thromboembolectomy was done. An arteriography was performed due to the persistence of pulsatile hematoma, which revealed a disruption of the axillary artery with extravasation of contrast near the humeral head (). An angioplasty balloon was introduced to control the proximal bleeding. After the introduction of the occlusion balloon, an incision was performed at the pectoralis major muscle and the hematoma was decompressed. The artery was deteriorated over about 1 cm and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The bilateral pulmonary embolism was probably due to the compression of the axillary vein during the shoulder dislocation. Nevertheless, no examination has confirmed this hypothesis. The patient received an intravenous anticoagulant therapy by heparin and then by an oral anticoagulant. Postoperatively, Doppler ultrasound showed a good morphologic and hemodynamic result. Concerning the functional outcome, the patient did not have neurological or vascular complications in the postoperative period. Then he presented with a partial functional disability probably due to a distal brachial plexus stunning according to results of electromyogram. The CT scan showed the absence of significant lesion of the rotator cuff.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe hip injury after falling from a bridge', 'Hematuria observed post-injury'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Initial Rx-ray', 'Finding': 'Femoral neck fracture with dislocation of femoral head into pelvis'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Anterior dislocation of femoral head suspected'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Femoral neck fracture with dislocation of femoral head', 'Type': 'Orthopedic injury', 'Location': 'Hip and pelvis'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgery - lateral approach of the hip with anterior capsulotomy', 'Details': 'Implantation of 50 mm Austin Moore prosthesis'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complicated due to retained fractured femoral head in pelvis', 'DischargeStatus': 'Further surgery required for femoral head extraction'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient underwent further surgeries and rehabilitation'}}}"
"A 26 year old male presented with increasing right knee pain and functional debility with a history of osteochondritis dissecans and having had multiple past surgical interventions. He was otherwise well, though was currently unable to perform any activities that involved prolonged weight bearing and found it increasingly difficult to continue his occupation within allied health care.\nThe patient noted an initial diagnosis of OCD at age 13. This was appropriately treated conservatively with a period of reduced load and protected weight bearing. He was later able to return to sport - which included Australian Rules football.\nDue to recurrence of pain he underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14. Arthroscopic probing of the OCD lesion indicated that it was stable and conservative management and further unloading was pursued. The patient failed conservative management and 1 year later underwent a repeat arthroscopy at which time an unstable 3 cm × 3 cm lesion involving his medial femoral condyle was removed. It was felt that as the fragment had little subchondral bone that direct repair was not achievable. A further arthroscopy was performed 8 months later and a chondral biopsy was taken for later autologous chondrocyte transplantation. At the time it was noted that no healing had occurred at the site of the defect.\nTwo months later, the treating surgeon, using a lateral arthrotomy approach, patched the defect using a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI). The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue. One year later, and due to persistent discomfort and swelling of the knee, the patient underwent a further arthroscopy. It was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, yet an inner area of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm had failed to fill completely.\nAt age 23 and due to troubling discomfort and mechanical features of instability the patient underwent another arthroscopy. Numerous loose bodies within both the medial and lateral compartments were washed out. The area of the past OCD and MACI graft had failed with exposure of underlying subchondral bone and formation of a large subchondral cyst. Unstable edges of the area of MACI graft were debrided but as the entrance to the subchondral cyst was small a surgical decision was made not to further expose nor debride the cavity.\nFailing to symptomatically improve, the patient underwent a further arthrotomy with debridement of the subchondral cyst, after which it was filled with bone graft substitute cortico-cancellous crunch granules. A periosteal flap taken from the medial border of the tibia was then applied over the lesion. The patient underwent a final arthroscopy at age 25 for debridement of an unstable fibro-cartilaginous cap at the site of the past periosteal flap.\nIn total the patient underwent seven separate operations.\nInitial examination upon presentation showed evidence of a moderate right knee effusion. The patient had full range of motion and the knee was stable.\nRadiological examination included both X-Ray and MRI. X-Ray confirmed early degenerative change with intercondylar notch osteophytes consistent with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II. There was noted concavity to the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle consistent with the previous area of OCD (Fig. ). MRI showed marked abnormality over the weight bearing portion of the medial femoral condyle measuring 2.3 cm × 1.5 cm. The subchondral cyst had successfully been debrided and grafted and was no longer present on MRI. A thin layer of hyper-intense tissue incompletely covered the area of abnormal cortex (at site of past bone substitute grafting) (Fig. ). The area of pathology had a modified International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score of 4. In addition to routine MRI protocols, the method of T2-relaxation time cartilage mapping was used. T2 mapping indicated significantly elevated values within the thin layer overlying the osteochondral defect but also elevated values within the surrounding cartilage (Fig. ).\nThe patient sought advice regarding further interventions that may improve both his current symptoms but also his long-term prognosis as he wished to avoid progressive degeneration and early joint arthroplasty. After careful consideration and as he now had features of early degenerative change he was assessed as suitable for inclusion in an ethics approved, registered case series on the use of adipose derived MSC therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis.\nThe patient was given written information regarding the use of MSC therapy, including relative risks of MSC therapy and also relevant treatment alternatives that could otherwise be explored. Formal written informed consent was obtained prior to commencing therapy.\nAdipose tissue was chosen as a source of MSCs due to ease of harvest, abundance of MSCs and the observed chondrogenic potential of adipose derived MSCs. Bone marrow aspirate was considered an alternative source or MSCs but surprisingly has a relative paucity of MSCs – comprising .001–.02% of the mono-nucleated cell population in comparison to ~1–7% found within adipose tissue [–]. Many studies have indicated similar chondrogenic potential between bone marrow derived and adipose derived MSCs [].\nThe patient underwent an abdominal liposuction harvest procedure. Using a lateral abdominal approach, the subcutaneous fat was infiltrated with an anaesthetic tumescent fluid preparation comprising of 30 mls of 2% lignocaine, 1 ml of 1:1000 adrenaline, 1 ml of 8.4% bicarbonate suspended in a normal saline solution (total 1000 ml). Using a 4 mm lipo-aspirate cannula, 60 mls of adipose tissue and tumescent fluid was successfully harvested and collected within a sterile medical grade single use Shippert Tissu-Trans Collection filter (Shippert Medical, Colorado, USA). The sample was then transferred directly from the theatre via an air lock system to a laboratory clean room facility operated by Magellan Stem Cells (Magellan Stem Cells, Melbourne, Australia).\nAutologous MSCs were isolated and expanded from the harvested adipose tissue using previously published protocols []. The processing of the lipo-aspirate was performed within the environment of a Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Class II using strict sterile techniques.\nStromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from the lipo-aspirate was culture purified using standard growth media containing Minimum Essential Media Eagle (MEM) supplemented with 2 mM glutamate and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (HyClone – GE Healthcare, USA). The cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The adherent cells were cultured until 80% confluency in freshly added growth media. The cultured purified cells were then harvested at passage 0 (P0). These cells were further plated to tissue culture flasks and expanded up to passage 2 (P2). The cells were harvested and analyzed for cell count and viability using a Muse Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, USA). The harvested cells were washed three times to remove FBS and cryopreserved in cryovials using clinical grade qualified MSC cryoprotectant media and following a previously validated control rate freezing technique of 1 °C/min [, ]. The cryovials were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage until use.\nAt completion of isolation and expansion, the cells underwent independent phenotypic analysis at Monash University and were characterised by flow cytometry using Florescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Using standards established by the Internal Society of Cellular Therapy, the cells were assessed for the presence of positive surface markers CD 90, CD 73 and CD 105 and absence of hematopoetic surface markers CD14, CD19, CD34 and CD45 [] (Tables - and Fig. ). A further sample was sent for independent sterility testing for microbial growth.\nPrior to the intra-articular injection the cryopreserved cells were retrieved from the liquid nitrogen Dewar and thawed quickly within a sterile 37 °C water bath. The thawed cells were then washed in chilled PBS to remove cryoprotectant media, centrifuged and the resultant cell pellet re-suspended in clinical grade 0.9% normal saline. The cells were again analyzed for cell count and viability post thaw using the Muse Cell Analyzer. The cells were injected within 30 min of thawing.\nThe patient received a total of 118 million MSCs (viability 98%) suspended in 3mls of normal saline at commencement of therapy. A second injection of 50 million MSCs (viability 95%) at 6 months was also given.\nAt both injection time points the patient’s right knee was prepped using a chlorhexidine solution and draped. 2 mls of 1% lignocaine was infiltrated subcutaneously at the site of injection. Using a supero-lateral approach to the patella, and under sterile conditions and ultrasound guidance, the MSCs suspended in 3 mls of normal saline were injected into the intra-articular space.\nAfter the initial injection the patient was fitted with a medial compartment customised unloading knee brace to allow protected but full weight-bearing. This was achieved using an Ossur OA Unloader One brace (Ossur, Reykjavic, Iceland).\nThe patient was given post injection instructions, which included range of motion exercises and lower limb muscle activation exercises, and encouraged to perform repetitive low impact and low load exercises against minimal resistance on a stationary bike (continuous active motion versus continuous passive motion). This protocol was developed due to previously published evidence which has indicated the benefit of controlled load on cartilage health [].\nImportantly, recent systematic review and meta-analysis of previous clinical papers investigating the use of mesenchymal stem cell therapy – both intravascular and intra-articular applications – and including autologous, allogeneic and expanded MSC preparations has indicated that MSC therapy is safe. No adverse events including infection, death or malignancy have been recorded.\nSaw and colleagues have documented a self-limited flare up with discomfort and swelling following intra-articular MSC therapy []. This was not considered a serious adverse event.\nRelative risks of the liposuction harvest procedure include infection, bruising and post operative discomfort. Whilst the risk of infection is low, the patient received a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure as part of accepted routine clinical practice [].\nProspective analysis of patient outcome to intra-articular MSC therapy included the following measures:The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). This is a validated scoring system intended for the assessment of knee injury that may result in post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis. The score consists of 5 subscales - pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life. Standardised answers to questions are given (5 Likert scale) and each question is assigned a score of 0–4. A normalized score is calculated for each subscale (100 indicates no symptoms and 0 indicates maximum symptoms) []. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC Index 3.0). This score is a validated quality of life score and quantitatively assesses the pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis []. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The patient rates their knee pain intensity over the previous week on a scale of 0–10. The NPRS has been validated for use in people with knee osteoarthritis [].\nOutcome scores were completed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post commencement of MSC therapy and recorded using the software program Clinical Intelligence (Clinical Intelligence, Melbourne, Australia).\nStructural outcome was assessed using MRI imaging performed prior to commencement of therapy and again at 6 and 18 months post-treatment. Semi quantitative measures of the cartilage defect were obtained using a modified ICRS score []:Grade 0: normal cartilage Grade 1: focal blistering and intra-cartilaginous low-signal intensity area with an intact surface and bottom Grade 2: irregularities on the surface or bottom and loss of thickness of less than 50% Grade 3: deep ulceration with loss of thickness of more than 50% Grade 4: full-thickness cartilage wear with exposure of subchondral bone.\nIn addition to routine MRI protocols, the method of T2-relaxation time cartilage mapping was used. T2 mapping assesses the water content of cartilage by giving a quantifiable value to the ability of free water protons to exchange energy and move through a cartilage matrix []. Observed increased water content resulting in an increased T2 relaxation time is an indication of chondral pathology. T2 mapping has been well studied and is an accepted and validated non invasive measure of cartilage quality [].\nThe numeric pain rating score increased at 1 month from 4 to 5 reflecting an initial self-limiting flare up (see Adverse Events). Follow-up at 6 months however showed a 50% improvement in NPRS from baseline and this had further improved by 75% with a pain score of 1 at completion of follow-up at 18 months (Fig. ).\nKnee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores consistently improved across the period of follow-up (Fig. ). At 6 months the patient’s Symptoms Score had improved by 44% and similarly his Sport and Recreational Score had improved by over 100%. These values showed continued improvement at 18 months. The measure of Quality of Life had improved at 18 months by greater than 400% above baseline.\nReflecting the observed improvement in KOOS, the WOMAC Knee Score showed similar consistent improvement from baseline till completion of data collection. At 18 months, the Global WOMAC Score had improved by over 20% (Fig. ).\nStructural follow-up using MRI at both 6 months and 18 months showed significant increase in tissue covering the extensive OCD of the medial femoral condyle. Observed development of a subchondral plate suggested a layering effect from subchondral bone through to the chondral surface. There was smooth integration with the surrounding native cartilage at the periphery of the OCD (Figs. and ). Using the modified ICRS scoring system as described above, ICRS grade improved from 4 to 1.\nT2 mapping at 6 months returned elevated values at the site of regenerative cartilage, consistent with high water content and immature cartilage (Fig. ). Further analysis at 18 months, however, indicated improved T2 values suggestive of progressive maturation of the regenerative tissue (Fig. ).\nFollowing initial MSC therapy the patient reported swelling and increased discomfort of the treated knee. The knee effusion persisted for 6 weeks. This was managed conservatively with application of ice, a compression bandage and simple analgesia. Due to this observed reaction the second injection at 6 months was reduced to 50 million MSCs (viability of 95%). The patient reported minor swelling and discomfort for 2 weeks, with no additional management required.","{

"Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region ().

The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation ().

"A 56-year-old female was initially admitted to the neurosurgical department because of retroorbital pain and mild visual deterioration in both eyes. The ophthalmologic examination showed a bilateral constriction of the visual field and a slight reduction in the visual acuity on the right side. A magnetic resonance of the brain and a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) disclosed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the ICA on the right side (). Although there is no randomized evidence showing that the FDs are superior to the conventional treatment options, the FD option was considered for the following reasons: the paraclinoid ICA represents one of the best targets for such devices [], there were no anatomical limitations to a correct deployment, and, by inducing aneurysm shrinkage, it might have been possible to relieve the mass effect on the optic pathways []. The ophthalmic aneurysm was initially loosely coiled and then a Pipeline FD was placed in the parent artery across the aneurysm neck (). The FD was well deployed and the landing zone extended from the supraclinoid ICA to the cavernous ICA (). There was only a mild focal narrowing at the level of the distal ring where the ICA was compressed by the bulk of the aneurysms against the clinoid process (). The visual acuity deteriorated acutely on both sides despite corticosteroids. The patient was discharged home after 7 days with double antiplatelet medication (75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin per day). Three months after the procedure, in concomitance with the cessation of the clopidogrel, she acutely developed a hemiparesis on the left side that lasted 48 hours. Then, she began suffering from transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). A DSA disclosed the thrombosis of the FD with occlusion of the ICA (). The patient continued suffering from multiple TIAs despite the resumption of antiplatelet medications, adequate hydration, and a thorough blood pressure monitoring to prevent hypotension. A perfusion-weighted CT scan demonstrated a significant increase in the mean transit time and a reduction in the cerebral blood flow on the right side (). The patient underwent a double-barrel extraintracranial (EC-IC) bypass with the occipital artery and the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery as donors. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she has experienced no further TIAs. The follow-up DSA 3 months later confirmed the patency of the bypasses (Figures -).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Underwent right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis', 'Epidural catheter broke during removal'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'No evidence of abnormality in the spinal area'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Migration of the catheter between L2 and L3 spinous processes'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'No specific diagnosed disease', 'Type': 'N/A', 'Location': 'Spinal area'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical removal of retained catheter', 'Details': 'Laminectomy performed at L2-3 to remove the catheter'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful removal of the catheter with no complications', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'N/A', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No neurological deficit found post-removal'}}}"
"A 63-year-old German man with a long past history of tumours was admitted to hospital. 20 years ago a malignant melanoma had been diagnosed on his right loin and radical excision performed. Due to lymph node metastasis in the left groin the patient had chemotherapy. After some time the patient developed haematuria whereupon renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed in the right kidney and a metastasis of the melanoma was found in the left kidney. Partial nephrectomy on the right and complete nephrectomy on the left were performed. The patient had since been free of tumour recurrence until presentation.\nA recent chest X-ray showed a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung . Two computer tomography examinations of the chest (fig ) were performed but could not conclusively rule out the possibility of metastasis. It was diagnosed initially as an inflammatory process of the lung. When the shadow failed to change with time further investigations were ordered. This was when a tumour in the right atrium was discovered which was neither haemodynamically nor clinically relevant. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest showed a spherical tumour (28 × 27 × 20 mm) attached to the wall of the right atrium. The T1 weighted image revealed homogenous signal intensity as well as a loss of signal due to fat tissue. The tumour didn't show any signs of contrast medium uptake so that the diagnosis of a benign lipoma was made preoperatively. Transthoracic echocardiography excluded heart valve dysfunction and confirmed the presence of a mass in the right atrium.\nOn account of the above-mentioned criteria and of the absence of metastasis of the melanoma excision of the lipoma as well as a biopsy of the mass in the right lower lobe was planned. The patient was clinically stable. Heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and lab results were normal with the exception of urea & electrolytes. After careful preparations the lipoma excision was carried out through incision of the right atrium while the patient was supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. The tumour was walnut-sized, yellow, had a smooth surface and was attached to the lateral wall of the right atrium. The excision was performed at the base of the lipoma in the atrial wall. The atrium was then sutured. Afterwards, with the patient now being supported by partial cardiopulmonary bypass, the right lung was inspected. A hard resistance could be palpated in the right lower lobe. Considering the uncertainty of its nature and the use of extracorporeal circulation lobectomy was not performed. A biopsy was performed instead. The pleura was closed and the operation successfully completed.\nThe patient recovered well on the ward and was discharged 9 days after the operation with an appointment for a partial lobectomy at a different hospital. Macroscopical and histological examination of the cardiac tumour showed a tumour measuring 40 × 25 × 20 mm, grey-yellowish coloured on cross section with adequate excisional margin. It was attached to the atrial myocardium which showed signs of interstitial fibrosis. The mesenchymal tumour was capsulated and found to be of variable width and made up of unilocular uniform adipocytes with small nuclei and focal regressive changes as well as focal giant cell granulomas. Thus, the diagnosis lipoma was correct and a good prognosis can be expected. As for the lung tumour a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed.","{

"A male patient aged 60 years reported to the department with the complaint of a hole in upper jaw for 2 years. History revealed that he got his denture constructed 10 years back and wearing the suction cup denture [] entire day and night and removed them only for cleaning. On examination of the palate, there was a perforation in the palate measuring approximately 2.5 cm × 2 cm in size []. The condition has started as an erythematous patch and has developed over a period of 2 years as a fistula to the current size. On palpation, margins were non tender. All surrounding tissues appeared normal in color and texture. When the patient was asked to gargle water, it escaped through his nose. The maxillary occlusal radiograph showed the loss of bone from mid palate region []. Patient's medical history was uneventful, and blood investigations were within normal limits. Serological investigations also showed a negative report for venereal diseases. The patient was advised to discontinue the denture immediately, and the surgery was planned by preferring the palatal rotational flap.\nThe surgical closure of palatal fistula planned under general anesthesia. It was induced by nasotracheal intubation. Patient placed in the supine position and neck extension achieved by keeping a pillow under the shoulder. Local anesthesia with adrenaline was injected around the lesion for hemostasis. The margins of the fistula were excised to remove the epithelial lining. A palatal flap design was planned based upon the course of the greater palatine artery and marked according to the site and size of the defect []. A partial thickness flap was raised and rotated laterally to cover the defect []. The flap was then secured in its new place using 3–0 black silk sutures []. The donor area which was covered by the periosteum of the palatal bone was the left open for a secondary epithelization. Beta dine dressing was given over the entire area []. One week postoperative review showed that the defect area healed without infection, dehiscence, and the donor site was covered with normal fibrin []. Fifteen days after surgery, the wound in the defect area healed well and the donor site was fully covered with granulation tissue []. Clinical review 2 months later showed healthy pink epithelium covering the donor site on the hard palate []. The bulky palatal flap had shrunk considerably so that the hard palate had retained its normal shape. The patient was referred to prosthodontics for new denture construction.","{

"A six year-old boy presented with a congenital anomaly of two upper limbs on the right side [Figures –]. Clinical examination revealed that the superior limb was articulating with the shoulder joint, and the inferior limb laterally attached to the chest wall. Both these limbs on the right side were hypoplastic compared to the left upper limb. The superior limb was approximately 7 cm shorter than the opposite limb (normal side), the superior limb being 33 cm in length from the shoulder joint while the inferior limb was 18 cm from the attachment with the chest wall. The skin over the forearm on the superior limb was shiny and atrophic with very little soft tissue mass compared with the inferior limb which was bulkier with normal-appearing skin. The superior limb was articulating with the torso via a normal shoulder joint. The scapula was small compared to that on the opposite side. The inferior limb was attached to the lateral thoracic wall by soft tissue at the level of the 4th intercostal space. The superior limb had a humerus, a single bone at the forearm level, and a duplicated thumb with an index finger. There was synostosis at the elbow joint and the wrist joint was stable. All fingers showed symphalyngism; the middle ray including the 3rd metacarpal was absent. The inferior limb had two fingers and a single bone with which it was attached to the chest wall. Clinically, the superior limb presented a picture of an ulnar hypoplastic hand where there was a stable wrist joint and a fused elbow joint. The inferior limb presented like a radial club hand with instability of the wrist joint. All movements were possible at the shoulder joint level but none were possible at the elbow joint and the wrist joint in the superior limb. Hand function was better in the inferior limb. The hand flexors were stronger in the inferior limb while the extensors were stronger in the superior limb. The clavicular head of the pectoralis was attached to the superior limb while the sternal head was attached to the inferior limb; the latissmus dorsi was inserted into the inferior limb.\nAn X-ray was taken of the right upper limb [], and color Doppler, and MR Angiography were done.\nThe X-ray [] revealed that the scapula on the right side was hypoplastic and the superior limb had a shoulder joint with elbow joint synostosis.\nColor Doppler study [] showed duplication of the right subclavian artery with separate origin of the inferior accessory subclavian artery. There was a patent radial artery with a inner diameter of 1.7 mm in the superior limb (radial) whereas there was a patent ulnar artery with a inner diameter of 2.0 mm in the inferior limb.\nMagnetic Resonance Angiography [] confirmed the findings of the color Doppler and the duplication of the subclavian vessels was found to arise from the infraclavicular level. The duplicated vessels running to the inferior limb were running along the lateral chest wall into the limb; the nerves also coursed along with the vessels.\nOur goal was to transfer the inferior limb to the superior forearm as a neurovascular island, and to recreate the hand without compromising the existing function and vascularity.\nAn encircling incision was made around the inferior limb, the pectoralis major and the latissmus dorsi muscle attachments were divided, and the neurovascular pedicle was dissected and mobilised up to its anomalous origin in the infraclavicular region from the subclavian vessels. The inferior limb was then transferred to the superior forearm.\nZigzag incisions were made on corresponding sides of the skin on the forearm and hand. The transverse metacarpal ligament was created and carpal bones were approximated with nonabsorbable sutures. [Figures –]\nThe postoperative period was uneventful and the existing hand functions [Figures –] were preserved. However, the abduction and external rotation at the shoulder joint was reduced because of the tautness of the transferred neurovascular pedicle and the bulk added at the forearm level.\nPhysiotherapy and re-education in terms of holding objects has been started early. The patient has been kept on regular follow-up and further staged procedures like distraction and synostosis of the elbow joint and debulking have been planned to provide a better functional and aesthetic limb.

"This case study is a product of serendipity. A 27 year old female runner was initially part of an experimental study documenting the muscle onset timing of the posterior leg and trunk muscles during the prone leg extension. At the time of the study the participant had no leg or spine injuries. The participant was part of the asymptomatic control group. Five months after the completion of the study this participant suffered an inversion right ankle sprain during a rainstorm while leaping into a camping tent filled with children. At 2 and 8 weeks post ankle sprain the PLE extension test was performed while recording the posterior muscle activation EMG to determine if an ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during the PLE as compared with an injury-free PLE onset timing pattern.\nTwenty seven year old female distance runner (height – 167 cm, weight -58 kg) suffered a right ankle inversion sprain. X rays revealed no fractures. Informed consent to participate in this study was received from the subject. In the initial study the participant read and signed an information and consent form that was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC. For the second half of the study the subject was notified of the risks and benefits of the study which complied with the World Medical Association declaration of Helsinki on the ethical conduct of research using human participants within a private practice and agreed to have her results published.\nNo passive therapy was received by the participant. The participant was encouraged to perform daily weight bearing exercise and range of motion exercises. The participant was running within two weeks of the injury with pain and not at her pre injury level. At two weeks post injury the participant reported that she felt she was functioning at 60% of her optimum. At 8 weeks post injury the participant reported that she was running 95% pain free with little loss of function.\nAn identical testing protocol was used across the 3 experimental days (pre injury, 2 weeks post injury and 8 weeks post injury). The muscle activity of the right gluteus maximus, bilateral lower erector spinae, and right hamstring muscle groups was recorded during right prone leg extension while lying prone on a manual therapy table. The position of the leg was controlled in all planes (no hip adduction/abduction or internal/external rotation) visually by the experimenter. A rig restricting movement or a kinematic analysis system to ensure an identical movement across trials was not used as this is not similar to what occurs during practice. The control of proper form was limited to a visual assessment as this most resembles clinical practice.\nDisposable bipolar Ag-AgCl disc surface electrodes with a diameter of one cm were adhered bilaterally over the five muscle groups with a centre to centre spacing of 1 cm. Raw EMG was amplified 5000 times. The amplifier has a CMRR of 10,000:1 (Bortec EMG, Calgary AB, Canada). Raw EMG was band pass filtered (10 and 1000 Hz) and A/D converted at 2000 Hz using a National Instruments data acquisition system.\nThe prone leg extension exercise was performed five times during each experimental session. The task required the subject to lie prone at complete rest with no movement while the EMG from each muscle was collected for 5 seconds. The subject then extended their straight right leg approximately six inches off the table. The leg was held isometrically for 3 seconds then lowered to the table.\nThe data from each PLE trial was processed in the same manner. The aim of the processing for this study was to determine the order and timing of muscle activation. To determine muscle timing, it is necessary to determine when a muscle is considered active or ""on"". A muscle was considered ""on"" when the level of muscle activity was greater than 10% of the peak muscle activity during the prone leg extension. This method of determining muscle onset was used in the previous study by Bullock-Saxton et al []. The order of activation can then be determined by classifying each muscle as ""on"" when its level of activity exceeds that of its predetermined threshold. Muscle activation time (milliseconds-ms) was referenced to the time of activation of the hamstring muscle. For example, positive values (ms) occurred when a muscle's onset occurred before activation of the hamstring muscle group, and negative values indicated that muscle activation occurred after the onset of the hamstring muscle. The onset of muscle activity was determined for each muscle during each repetition of the prone leg lift. Please note that the EMG activity was not normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). While MVCs are important in the collection of EMG when there is a need for determining muscle amplitude, this was not necessary in the current study because muscle timing rather than amplitude was measured. Normalization would not influence the muscle onset results.\nThe data was processed in the following manner: The raw EMG signal was first full wave rectified, then smoothed using a moving average technique which averaged every 100 points of data with an overlap 98 points. The bias was removed from the signal to allow resting activity to be at 0. The peak muscle activity was found and each data point was divided by this peak muscle activity. In this way, muscle onset could be determined by determining the time when the myoelectric signal exceeded 10% of the maximum. The signal was visually inspected to ensure that no artefact occurred or that the results were biologically feasible.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaint of a large painless mass in the posterior side of the left thigh for over a year', 'No other constitutional symptoms reported'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalHistory': {'RCC': {'Diagnosis': 'Stage II RCC', 'Treatment': 'Left nephrectomy'}, 'Metastasis': {'Location': 'Tail of pancreas and tip of spleen', 'Treatment': 'Total resection of pancreas and spleen'}}, 'FollowUp': {'LastVisit': '2 years ago', 'Findings': 'Slightly increased hypermetabolic area in the biceps femoris muscle'}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'FDG-PET/CT', 'Finding': 'Hypermetabolic activity with an uptake value of 3.8 to 4.1 in biceps femoris muscle'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Encapsulated mass with a mesenchymal component, raising the possibility of a liposarcoma or an angiosarcoma'}, {'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Well-defined adipose tissue, high suspicion for malignancy'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Metastasis from RCC', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Posterior side of left thigh'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical resection after preembolization', 'Details': 'Resected mass measured 28 x 17 x 7 cm'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'RCC metastasis to lateral ventricle in the brain'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Symptoms monitoring and further treatment planning required'}}}"
"A 11 years old male was referred to the emergency department of Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital due to a slight periodontal bleeding of 5 days of evolution. An orthopantomography was performed to focus the diagnosis. The OPG evidenced a dubious periapical image compatible with a small cyst of dental origin. Hence, the doctors of the emergency service decided to contact with the maxillofacial surgery department. A new clinical examination evidenced a spontaneous alveolar bleeding and high mobility of the first and second molars of the fourth mandibular quadrant. The patient denied cervicofacial trauma or pathologies of the coagulation system. Thus, a CT scan of the cervicofacial area was performed to reach a diagnosis. Surprisingly, this test evidenced a large high-flow intraosseous arteriovenous malformation extending from the right mandibular body to the homolateral pterygoid region and the infratemporal fossa (Fig. ). Moreover, a selective arteriography and a MRI of head and neck were also carried out to identify the limits of the malformation and the key vessel (Fig. ). Considering these findings, we contacted with the interventional radiology unit of the Hospital in order to plan a combined approach. However, after a careful analysis we decided to treat the patient only with an endovascular approach. Specifically, a very large drainage vein was identified with the radiological tests. Hence, we hypothesized that the embolization of this vein and the selective embolization of the main arterial vessels might be enough to treat the pathology. Thus, under general anesthesia and femoral approach, the embolization of the main drainage vein and of the most accessible arteries was carried out. The patient was maintained intubated and sedated for 24 hours and he was extubated when the bleeding had completely stopped. He was discharged from the hospital 7 days after the procedure. In fact, a control arteriography performed 5 day after embolization showed a significant reduction of the size of the lesion. A MRI performed three months after the procedure evidenced the complete regression of the lesion. Furthermore, in a new control 18 month after the patient has no clinical signs of recurrence (Fig. ). Hence, this approach could avoid an extremely mutilating surgery and severe psychological sequels.","{

"A 64-year-old gentleman with a post radiation recurrent squamous carcinoma of the left lower alveolus was posted for composite resection and reconstruction with fibula free flap by simultaneous two team approach. The left fibula was selected and after flap harvest, the left neck vessels (superior thyroid and facial) were assessed for the volume and character of the flow and were found to be good. The bone defect was extending from midline anteriorly to proximal ramus posteriorly and the soft-tissue defect was confined to the oral cavity []. The flap was designed in a manner so that the superior thyroid vessels were to be used as donor vessels as they were away from the previous zone of irradiation and the blood flow was also good after dissecting them and dividing to look for the volume and adequacy of blood flow. After osteotomy and preliminary intra oral in setting of the skin paddle, and during the time of anastomosis, it was found that the flow in the superior thyroid artery was inadequate after initial good flow. Routine measures such as application of warm saline, xylocaine solution and later papaverine did not improve the flow and in such a situation, the options available were\nTo open the right neck and use vessels from that side either directly or with a vein graft To use a vein graft and anastomose with the facial artery on the same (left) side as the flow in this vessel was good To use the distal end of the flap pedicle vessels for anastomosis with left facial artery, so as to establish the vascular flow in a retrograde manner. This was because the clipped distal ends of the peroneal pedicle vessels were near to the left facial artery.\nBefore exploring the opposite neck or harvesting a vein graft, a decision was made to attempt retrograde vascularisation of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. First, the arterial anastomosis was completed between the distal end of the peroneal artery and left facial artery (end-to-end) and the flow was checked. The arterial flow was good as evidenced by the pulsations of the donor and recipient vessels and with the venous outflow from the distal end of the peroneal venae commitantes. This was followed by venous anastomosis between the distal end of the peroneal venae commitantes and a tributary of the left internal jugular vein (end to end). The skin paddle bleeding was also good with a sterile needle prick. Thus, the vascularity was restored with retrograde flow and was well established by the time the intra oral inset was completed []. The neck was then closed and post-op period was uneventful. After 6 weeks, a computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed good establishment of blood flow to the neo mandible [Figures and ].","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['No symptoms or signs of abdominal mass apart from mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': True, 'Type2Diabetes': True, 'BreastCancerHistory': {'Type': 'Invasive ductal breast cancer', 'Treatment': {'Procedure': 'Lumpectomy', 'AdjuvantTherapy': 'Radiation therapy and chemotherapy', 'Medication': 'Anastrozole'}}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal CT', 'Findings': ['7 cm solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII', '1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas']}, {'Test': 'Tumor markers', 'Findings': ['AFP, CA 15–3, CA 19–9, and CEA all within normal limits']}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)', 'Type': 'Primary tumor', 'Location': 'Liver segments VI and VII'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Hepatic segmentectomy', 'Details': 'Resection of hepatic segments VI and VII with safe oncologic margins'}, 'PostoperativeCourse': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition', 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'Status': 'Disease-free', 'Imaging': 'Abdominal CT scans at first and sixth month postoperatively showed no recurrence'}}}}"
"A 32-yr-old woman with no relevant or significant medical history presented with severe left calf pain that had persisted for the past 10 yr. The symptom was constant and worsened with menstruation, standing or walking for more than 30 min. The pain was relieved by elevating the leg in the sitting position or massaging the calf muscles. The pain was not associated with any progressive neurologic symptoms or signs. She reported that none of the medications she had tried provided any significant pain relief. Intramuscular electrical stimulation for 4 months and repeated muscle injections with lidocaine were also ineffective. Alternative treatments including acupuncture and Korean herbal medications had been tried many times without much success.\nThe patient's pain drawing showed a pain pattern limited to the left calf, especially in the medial side, which indicated a referred pain pattern of medial gastrocnemius or soleus muscle (). Physical examination revealed severe tenderness on the medial side of the left calf muscles. Signs of calf swelling were equivocal. Deep tendon reflexes were normal in both sides. Muscle strength of both lower extremities was normal. Sensation in both lower extremities was intact. The straight leg raising test was normal. Conventional radiography of the left leg showed several mottled calcifications within the muscles but did not reveal erosions of tibia or fibula (). To rule out a possible vascular deformity, femoral angiography was performed and a hemangioma was suggested in the left calf (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower extremity was performed for further evaluation of these abnormalities and showed an enhancing soft-tissue mass in the medial aspect of the soleus muscle ().\nThe patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent excisional biopsy. Operative findings revealed a mass consisting of several irregular fragments of muscular soft tissue, measuring 6×6×4 cm. The final pathologic diagnosis was intramuscular hemangioma with fatty overgrowth isolated to the soleus muscle, which was in concordance with the MRI findings (). Within 1 month, the patient reported 90% pain relief and had discontinued all pain medications. Even with prolonged walking of more than 30 min, calf pain did not occur and the subject was able to resume mountain hiking 3 months following the operation.","```json

"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","```json

"An 88-year-old male presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered. The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","{

"A 50-year-old woman with left breast cancer was referred to the Plastic Surgery Department for immediate breast reconstruction. She had a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a lumbar peritoneal shunt tube had been implanted in her abdomen to treat hydrocephalus. She had no other obvious sequelae from the subarachnoid hemorrhage and her medical condition was quite stable with the shunt. Her breasts were large and drooping (), and left nipple areola sparing mastectomy was scheduled. A preoperative computed tomography scan showed the shunt tube, which pierced the intervertebral lumbar and traveled through the subcutaneous layer of the left trunk () and entered into the abdominal cavity from the outer edge of the left rectus abdominal muscle ().\nIn the selection of the reconstruction method, we thought that abdominal flap would be suitable because implant reconstruction would not achieve morphologically favorable results and because a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap would not have sufficient volume. However, it was considered that the shunt tube might cause difficulty in the elevation of the flaps.\nWe consulted brain surgeons on the feasibility of the abdominal flap operation and decided to withdraw the tube from the abdominal cavity once, when the flap was elevated, and to reinsert it upon the closure of the donor site. The patient consented to our preoperative explanation of the procedure and indicated that she desired to undergo DIEP flap reconstruction.\nShe underwent nipple areola sparing mastectomy of the left breast and immediate DIEP flap reconstruction. In the elevation of the flap, a skin incision was first made around the whole circumference of the flap and dissection was carried down to the muscle fascia. The shunt tube was confirmed above the fascia on the left side of the abdomen. The perforator vessel passing through the right rectus sheath, which had been confirmed by color Doppler ultrasound on the day before surgery, was secured and dissected to the right deep inferior epigastric vessels. As the shunt tube was placed on the left side, we prepared the pedicle of the DIEP flap on the right side. Although we could have used the penetrating branch on the left side containing the shunt tube, we considered that using the penetrating branch on the right side that had not previously undergone surgical operation would be safer. The shunt tube, which was located on the fascia, was covered with fibrous tissue and was not directly exposed (). However, on the closure of the donor site, the shunt tube was obstructed as it was excessively bent. We, therefore, dissected the tube from the surrounding tissue and temporally withdrew it from the abdominal cavity and re-inserted it 5-cm caudal from its original position by a brain surgeon (). After surgery, the patient had a smooth recovery and we found no signs of increased intracranial pressure or complications of abdominal wall. Partial necrosis of the spared skin of the breast occurred but was successfully treated following a conservative approach.\nSince her breast cancer was less than 1 cm in diameter and classified as clinical stage 1 (T1N0M0), adjuvant therapy after surgery was expected to be unnecessary. Thus, immediate reconstruction was performed. However, a sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive, and broad invasion of the primary tumor was observed in the pathological examination. Therefore, she received postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and there was no recurrence of the breast cancer and her reconstructed left breast showed good shape and symmetry in comparison with the right breast at one 1 year after surgery ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket'], 'MedicalHistory': {'ImplantHistory': {'InitialImplantation': {'Year': 1990, 'AtrialLead': 'Medtronic 4504 passive fixation', 'VentricularLead': 'Medtronic 4004 passive fixation'}, 'Replacement1998': {'Year': 1998, 'AtrialLead': 'Medtronic 5568 active fixation', 'VentricularLead': 'Medtronic 4068'}, 'GeneratorChange2011': {'Year': 2011, 'LeadAbandoned': True}}, 'PriorSurgeries': ['Dual chamber pacemaker implantation in 1990', 'Generator replacement in 1998 and 2011', 'Lead replacement in 2003']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Blood cultures', 'Finding': 'No growth of bacterial or fungal organisms'}, {'Test': 'Trans-esophageal echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'No vegetations on the leads, suspicion of extravascular atrial lead'}, {'Test': 'Chest CT imaging', 'Finding': 'Right atrial lead tip within pericardial space'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Suspected pacemaker pocket infection', 'Type': 'Infection', 'Location': 'Pacemaker pocket'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Transvenous and open surgical lead extraction', 'Details': 'Involving removal of all pacemaker leads, debridement of infected pocket, and placement of new epicardial lead'}, 'PostoperativeCourse': {'Recovery': 'Complicated with hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia, resolved after 5 days', 'DischargeStatus': 'Transferred back to home hospital for ongoing rehabilitation'}}}"
"A 55-year-old female admitted to us with complaints of 40% acute flame burns to the neck, chest anterior abdominal wall, and upper limbs. The patient had a history of multiple abdominal surgeries secondary to tuberculosis 10 years back. She had an exploratory laparotomy which ended up having a burst abdomen, for which a temporary colostomy was done and closed, due to which she developed a large ventral hernia. Five years later, the patient underwent an open mesh repair, which got infected, and the mesh had to be removed. When she presented to us, the skin over a ventral hernia had second-degree deep dermal burns which were grafted. The patient after rehabilitation from burn wounds came back again for a ventral hernia repair. The patient had Type 2 abdominal wall defect []. The patient deferred the option of the microvascular free flap.\nWe planned a TFL graft harvested from the left thigh for closing the rectus defect and an islanded TFL myocutaneous flap from right thigh for the abdominal defect.\nOn the table, the edge of a hernia was incised. The skin adherent to peritoneum was excised. There was a defect of 20 cm × 12 cm in the lower two-third of the abdomen in the midline. A fascia lata graft was harvested from left thigh measuring 18 cm × 10 cm and sutured to the edge of the abdominal wall []. On the right side, the TFL islanded flap was elevated of about 30 cm × 10 cm in dimension and turned 120° for the distal end of the flap to reach the upper limit of the abdominal defect []. The segment between the proximal end of the flap and the lower end of the abdominal defect in the right iliac region was incised and opened up to the external fascia to accommodate the bridging segment of the flap. The fascia was reinforced to the inside wall edge, and the skin was sutured with a closed suction drain. The donor area was closed primarily [].\nThe postoperative period was uneventful. The closed suction drain removed on the 6th postoperative day, and the sutures were removed on the 14th postoperative day. At 6-month follow-up, no herniation of the abdominal contents was obtained. Thigh donor site healed without any complications [].","{

"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Hypertension and dyslipidemia', 'Traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': True, 'Dyslipidemia': True, 'PreviousInjury': 'Traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan in 2013', 'Finding': 'Partial inward deviation of intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal ultrasound in March 2020', 'Finding': 'Irregular abdominal aortic aneurysm with a maximum short diameter of 36 mm'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)', 'Type': 'Irregular', 'Location': 'Infrarenal aorta'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Y graft replacement', 'Details': 'J graft 16 × 8 mm replacement with distal anastomosis to common iliac arteries'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No further complications', 'DischargeStatus': '8 days postoperatively'}}}"
"A male patient aged 62 years reported to our center with the chief complaint of dull gnawing pain and a growth in the mouth [] of 5 years duration associated with difficulty in eating and swallowing. The history revealed that the patient had met with a road traffic accident 5 years back which resulted in injuries to his upper front teeth, lower lip, and left side of the face. A few months after the injury, he noticed a small growth on the left side of the upper gums that progressively increased slowly to the present size. There was a sudden surge in growth 20 days before presentation to our department after the patient removed a tooth fragment sticking to the growth. There was a gross asymmetry of face caused by the diffuse swelling involving the lower two-third of the left side of the face. Superoinferiorly, it extended from the infraorbital region to the lower border of the mandible and the anteroposterior extent was from the midline to the left preauricular region. The mass was reddish pale, exophytic with a lobulated surface, measuring approximately 10 cm × 6 cm and was protruding from the oral cavity causing inability to close the mouth. The growth was attached to the left maxillary alveolus and palate and not fixed to the buccal mucosa or vestibular sulcus. It did not show any focus of surface ulceration, but bleeding spots were distributed randomly. The upper posterior teeth were displaced and attached to the mass on the palatal side. On palpation, the growth was firm and tender with an irregular surface and was fixed to the upper left alveolus. A computed tomography angiogram was taken to check the vascularity of the lesion which revealed no irregular feeder vessels. Further imaging showed a soft-tissue shadow with calcifications. The soft-tissue shadow measured approximately 10 cm × 6 cm in size not involving the mandible but causing destruction of maxilla in the premolar region. Routine blood investigations and serology tests were done. Since it was an abnormally extensive lesion, we approached by giving Weber Fergusson with lateral limb modification connected with intraoral vestibular degloving incision to have a complete access of the lesion []. Then, peripheral osteotomy cut was given to facilitate easy release and that the lesion was excised completely out of the maxilla. The raw area was packed with iodoform gauze. Obturator was constructed postoperatively to close the palatal fistula. During follow-up, wound shrunk and obturator was replaced with maxillary prosthesis. The mass was sent for histopathological examination []. The weight of the excised mass was approximately 230 g. The differential diagnosis given for the mass was fibroma, ossifying fibroma, peripheral giant cell granuloma, pyogenic granuloma, fibrosarcoma. The histopathological examination of the soft-tissue specimen revealed fibrous, connective tissue with numerous plump fibroblasts []. Numerous areas showed ossification in the connective tissue. Chronic inflammatory cells and blood vessels were also seen. All of which suggested the mass be a peripheral ossifying fibroma []. Postsurgical recovery was uneventful and the 6 months follow-up revealed no evidence of recurrence.","{

"A 21-year-old female patient presented with throbbing pain in relation to upper left canine tooth. The tooth had a history of occasional pain since 1 year and was related to have started following an orthognathic surgery done on upper maxilla. On examination she had pain on vertical and lateral percussions on that tooth. The radiograph of the area revealed a root injury in the middle third of the root and the possibility of endodontic involvement of the area. The distal area of the tooth had a periodontal pocket of 9mm probing depth as seen in .\nThe patient was unwilling for extraction of the tooth and its prosthetic rehabilitation. She was referred to do root canal treatment for the immediate management of pain. Her tooth was endodontically treated as shown in , and she was relieved of acute symptoms and periodontal pocket became inactive. Although she was supposed to report for the periodontal review, upon relieved from acute symptoms she did not turn up.\nSix months later, the patient reported with a painful periodontal abscess and a draining sinus opening in relation to the periapex of the same tooth. The gingiva in relation to the abscess was edematous and purulent exudation was noticed draining through the periodontal pocket and the sinus opening as well []. The radiograph showed fast resorption of the root area in the border of lesion with an ample alveolar bone loss surrounding it [].\nThe patient still resisted removal of the tooth and insisted on any treatment to restore her natural teeth as long as possible. Modified Widman flap[] surgery along with restoration of the root lesion with glassionomer cement was proposed and the patient was willing for the treatment. The possibility of treatment failure following root fracture and the recurrence of pocket following non-adaptation of the gingival tissue on the restorative surface were explained to the patient.\nIn order to control the inflammatory status of the gingiva and to drain the abscess for a firm and less hemorrhagic area for operation, a closed curettage of the pocket followed by subgingival irrigation with 0.12% Chlorhexidine gluconate were performed. She was prescribed a course of antibiotic (Tab. Doxicycline - 100 mg) for 10 days. She was recalled after 14 days, the gingiva appeared more firm, exudation through gingival sulcus stopped, and the sinus opening had disappeared. But the disto-labial area of the canine and its distal surface had 10 and 9 mm of periodontal pocket, respectively.\nThe objectives of the treatment approach were to establish a proper surgical access to the resorbing root area, freshen the lesion, and restore the root region with Glass ionomer cement and the flap has to be adapted over the restoration and root.\nModified Widman flap surgery with a single vertical incision distal to first premolar was performed exposing the bony defect and injured root area. The area was thoroughly debrided [] the injured root surface was prepared with a micro motor to expose fresh dentin to receive restoration. The prepared root surface was restored with Glass ionomer cement (Fuji II) and after its initial setting, the excess cement were planed and smoothened as seen in []. The flap was adapted back in its previous position and sutured tightly to the teeth. The immediate post-operative clinical and radiographical view of the area is shown in and , respectively. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg and paracetamol 500 mg t.i.d. for next 7 days and the sutures were removed after 10 days.\nThe patient was recalled after 6 months for clinical and radiographical evaluation. Clinically, there were no signs of inflammation in the area of surgery and the flap showed a complete adaptation to the root surface []. Radiograph of the area indicated bone deposition in close proximity to the restoration and the root resorption seems to have not progressed since the restoration [].\nThe patient was again reviewed after one more year (18 months post operatively) for clinical and radiographical evaluation of the healing. Clinically, the flap exhibited close adaptation with the restoration surface with probing depth of just 1 mm [], indicating an attachment gain of 8 mm. The radiographic view of the area at this time showed considerable bone apposition around the restoration surface and a clear alveolar crestal bone substantiating the clinical findings []. The aggressive root resorption following the periodontal abscess had completely ceased.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaint of pain in the region of the right posterior teeth of the lower jaw', 'Asymptomatic swelling on the right side of face since birth'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousExamination': 'Examination at 8 months of age', 'GradualIncrease': 'Swelling extent increased with age', 'Asymmetry': 'Asymmetry of face persisted', 'Birth': {'Delivery': 'Normal delivery', 'Term': 'Full term'}, 'BuildAndIntelligence': {'Build': 'Normal', 'Intelligence': 'Normal'}, 'FamilyHistory': {'ConsanguineousMarriage': 'No history of consanguineous marriage', 'FamilialComplaints': 'No familial history of similar complaints'}, 'SerumChemistry': 'No abnormalities'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Panoramic radiograph', 'Findings': [{'Asymmetry': 'Right mandibular body and ramus larger in size', 'Eruption': 'Accelerated eruption of teeth on right side', 'RootFormation': 'Accelerated root formation on right side teeth', 'CondyleAndCoronoidProcess': 'Large with prominent sigmoid notch on right side'}]}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Findings': [{'Tissue': 'Diffuse lipomatous tissue in right cheek region and pterygomandibular space', 'FattyInfiltration': 'Infiltration in tissues around maxillary sinus and mandible on right side'}]}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Findings': [{'Mass': 'Large hypodense well-defined mass causing severe swelling in right cheek', 'Interior': 'Enhancing hyperdense septae within mass', 'Enlargement': 'Mandible, base of skull, maxillary sinus, pterygoid plates larger on right side'}]}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Benign soft tissue mass', 'Type': 'Developmental anomaly', 'Location': 'Right cheek region, pterygomandibular space'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Observation and monitoring', 'Details': 'Monitoring development of mass and associated structures'}}}"
"Our case was a 20 year old female with road traffic accident. An informed consent was taken from her for publication purposes. Her left leg was crushed under a truck tyre and she presented with a grade IIIb compound fracture tibia with a 20cm by 8 cms wound over the anteromedial side of lower third of tibia, extending over to the medial side of ankle joint and foot. Periosteum was seen exposed in lower third of tibia and wound was badly contaminated. Radiographs of the leg showed a distal third tibia fracture with a segmental piece of tibia which was further comminuted. The fibula fracture was at the same level as tibia and was short oblique fracture. Patient presented immediately after the injury and debridement was done within 2 hours of injury. A thorough wash was given with debridement of all dead and devitalized tissue. Fracture was fixed using a biplanar external fixator (). Wound dressing was done regularly and intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics were given. Two further debridements were needed and at 4 weeks the wound was healthy enough to perform a cross leg flap. At 3 weeks post flap surgery, the external fixator was removed due to multiple pin track infections and the limb was immobilized in a long leg cast. At 3 and half months post injury the wound was healthy. Radiographs showed that the segmental tibia fragment was showing good union response at the proximal end; however the distal end appeared to be rounded with attempt to callus formation which is non bridging (). Abnormal mobility at the fracture site indicated a need to stabilize the fracture, however soft tissue condition precluded any form of internal fixation. At that time the fibula fracture was completely united. A decision to do a posterior bone grafting along with bridge fibula grafting was taken to provide additional stability at the non union site. Lateral approach was taken and cancellous graft taken from the same side (right) iliac crest was filled in the interosseous membrane between tibia and fibula by at the site of the fracture, just proximal and just distal to it. Two 3.5 mm cortical screws were passed from the fibula to into the tibia at the site where the graft ends proximally and distally. This was done to make a rigid strut with cancellous graft in the middle (). Patient was put in a long knee brace and advised non-weight bearing for a period of 8 weeks. At two months after bridge grafting good callus was seen bridging the fracture and the patient was given a patella tendon bearing cast and was started on partial weight bearing. Complete union was achieved at 7 months post surgery. The ankle movement was 10 degree dorsiflexion from neutral and 20 degree plantar flexion from neutral position at that time. Patient resumed her activities at 8 months post trauma while screw removal was done at 18 months post injury. The patient was last followed up at 5 years post injury. She was walking full weight bearing and was able to carry out all her activities. The medial soft tissue scar was healthy. Ankle dorsiflexion was restricted to 10° but the plantar flexion was around 50° (). There was no history of pain or discharge from the injury site. The radiograph showed the fracture outline to have a silhouetted appearance with good union on posterior and medial side with good consolidation of the entire area of the bridge graft between tibia and fibula ().","{

For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Heavy bleeding postpartum requiring multiple interventions', 'Recurrent episodes of bleeding despite previous treatments'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousPregnancies': 'Gravidity 3, parity 2', 'PreviousBirths': [{'BabyWeight': '3500 grams', 'DeliveryMethod': 'Spontaneous vaginal delivery', 'Complications': 'Heavy bleeding at day 6 postpartum'}]}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal Ultrasonography', 'Finding': 'Normal ovaries, no fluid in abdominal cavity'}, {'Test': 'CT Scan with contrast enhancement', 'Finding': 'Aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area'}, {'Test': 'Angiography', 'Finding': 'Arteriovenous fistula and aneurysm filling from right internal iliac artery'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Postpartum hemorrhage', 'Type': 'Complication of childbirth', 'Location': 'Pelvic area'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Hysterectomy, cuff repair, bilateral hypogastric artery ligation, angiography with coil embolization', 'Details': 'Interventions to control bleeding and stabilize hemodynamics'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Full recovery achieved on postoperative day 15', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition upon discharge'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Until completion of the second procedure', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No recurrent bleeding during follow-up period'}}}"
"An 88-year-old male presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered. The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","{

"A 71-year old man was referred to our clinic for the sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change. The pain was located at mid thoracic area, and was positively related to motion. It started 5 days prior to the visit and the neurologic changes occurred the following day. Neurologic examination revealed grade IV motor power on both legs and hypoesthesia was present below the level of the xiphoid process. The patient was able to walk with the aid of a cane. He had been taking anti-arrhythmic medications for a year, and had no other past medical history.\nPlain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken from the other hospital revealed a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression (). Under an impression of the T8 pathologic fracture, we ran a series of tests to find the primary origin of the spinal metastasis. All laboratory tests including tumor markers were within normal limits. Chest and abdominal computed tomography scans did not show any mass lesions in solid organs. We discussed the plan for diagnosis with oncologists. Since the patient presented with neurologic symptoms in both lower extremities, we came to an agreement that planning an early spine surgery of T8 decompression and stabilization and making the pathologic diagnosis through tumor tissue removed during the surgery would be reasonable. Further systemic work ups such as whole body positron emission tomography was planned after confirmation of the pathologic diagnosis. No steroid therapy was performed during the preoperative period.\nA spinal embolization was performed prior to the operation. As a small size of the ASA was visualized on the left T8 segmental artery angiography (), only the right T8 segmental artery was embolized. On the following day, we carried out a total laminectomy of T8 and pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10. Tumors located at the ventral side of the dura sac were partially removed to achieve circumferential decompression of the spinal cord. For this procedure, we resected both T8 roots. The operation was uneventful. No significant changes were observed on neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring (NIOM) throughout the operation. Immediate postoperative neurologic examination showed no change in neurologic status compared to the preoperative state.\nAround 8 hours after the operation, the patient suddenly became paraplegic. Neurologic examination revealed motor power grade 0 on both lower extremities. Pain sensation was lost below the level of the xiphoid process, but touch sense and proprioception were intact. Under a suspicion of operation site hematoma, follow-up MRI was taken immediately. However, we could not identify any lesions causing the patient's paraplegia. No notable events such as hypotension during intraoperative and postoperative period was identified. Therefore, medical treatments, including hydration and high dose steroid injection, were administered and the patient was put on overnight observation.\nThe patient did not show any neurologic improvements the next morning. We discussed this situation with the neurology and radiology departments and concluded that the neurologic features were similar to ASA syndrome. Follow-up T2-weighted sagittal and axial T-spine MRI revealed a high signal change at the anterior half of the spinal cord around the T8 level which confirmed ischemia or infarction of the anterior spinal cord (). Anticoagulation with low molecular heparin and antiplatelet medication were added. Mean arterial blood pressure was monitored and kept above 70 mmHg to maintain spinal cord perfusion pressure. However, the patient's neurologic status did not recover. One week later, the remaining touch sense and proprioception of both lower extremities had also disappeared. The spinal pathology confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Throughout 6 months follow-up, the patient remained paraplegic without any neurologic improvements.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region', 'Previous infection in the same area, treated with antibiotics but unsuccessful'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInfection': 'Previous infection in the right mandibular molar region'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical Examination', 'Finding': 'Severe swelling without fluctuation, submandibular lymphadenopathy'}, {'Test': 'Radiographic Examination', 'Finding': 'Deep caries cavity, radiolucent area in apical region of right mandibular first molar tooth'}, {'Test': 'CBCT', 'Finding': 'Tunnel-like defect in cortical bone, bone deposition in radiolucent area'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': ""Garre's Osteomyelitis"", 'Type': 'Inflammatory bone disease', 'Location': 'Right mandibular molar region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Dental Extraction', 'Details': 'Surgical removal of the infected right mandibular first molar tooth'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Bone contours returned to normal, facial asymmetry disappeared, cortical bone remodeled'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Four months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient showed improvement and no complications'}}}"

"A 46-year-old female patient was admitted to our department due to a cystic tumor in pancreatic body and tail. Routine chemistry and tumor marker levels (CA 19-9, CEA, CA 125) were all within normal limits. Abdominal CT scan and EUS showed about 5×4 cm sized, slightly septated cystic tumor between the body and tail of the pancreas (). There was no mural nodule, no calcification, and no eccentrically located mass within the cystic area. The benign mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas was the most favorable preoperative diagnosis. The operation sequence was similar to usual laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy except trocar placement (). The robotic camera arm and other three instrument arms were then connected to their respective ports. At this point, the surgeon sat at the surgical console located about 3 m from the operating table. The assistant surgeon was positioned on the patient's left side for temporary use of laparoscopic instruments through Port 4. In spite of our previous experiences of robot surgical system, the cystic tumor and the remaining splenic vessels were so closely adherent that bleeding was frequently encountered, and most operation time was spent for this process. The risk of cyst rupture was also considered when we tried to separate and divide the small splenic vessels from pancreatic cyst (). Therefore, concomitant segmental resection of splenic vessels was thought to be necessary for spleen preservation. Total operation took about 480 minutes, and about 800 mL of blood loss was noted without blood transfusion. The specimen was delivered through the umbilical port site with small vertical incision after putting into the plastic bag. The patient recovered without complication. She returned to an oral diet on the postoperative second day. After the drain was removed, she was discharged on the fifth day post-operation. The final pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without any characteristics of malignant potential (). A color doppler ultrasound scan obtained 14 days after surgery showed no evidence of splenic infarction and well preserved blood flow within the spleen without definitive peripancreatic fluid collection ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Moderate to severe depression', 'Anxiety'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMentalHealthIssues': 'Known to local mental health services for the past 20 years', 'PreviousHospitalAdmissions': 'Two inpatient hospital admissions after attempting suicide'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Blood tests', 'Finding': 'Normal, except high C-Reactive Protein'}, {'Test': 'Physical examination', 'Finding': 'Conjunctivitis, swelling of face and lips, erosion of mucous membrane in mouth, erythematous papules and bullous eruptions on body'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Stevens - Johnson Syndrome', 'Type': 'Severe allergic reaction', 'Location': 'Whole body'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Stop all medications, supportive care', 'Details': 'Lamotrigine, along with other antidepressant medications, was stopped.

"A 35-year-old male farmer came in contact with 11,000 volts high tension electric wire while irrigating his field. This patient was initially admitted to general surgery ward from main casualty for management as he was having open abdominal wound and was managed there for initial 3 days. He had full thickness burn wounds over the right scapula, right upper limb and anterior abdominal wall along with perforation of the intestine. There was prolapse of the intestinal loops through abdominal wound. Patient was referred to our plastic surgery unit after 3 days. He presented to us in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place. Details of the preliminary management were unavailable except mention of putting in catheter drain through the open abdominal wounds. There was necrosis of burned skin and muscles over the right shoulder and abdomen []. Patient was initially managed conservatively with intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound and culture specific antibiotics. Patient responded well to the conservative management and once he was stable, a thorough debridement of the necrotic skin over the right shoulder and upper arm was performed. The area was then split skin grafted. The patient developed enterocutaneous fistula, which healed over a period of 8 weeks. The wound over the abdomen was also covered with skin graft and patient was discharged after 18 days [].\nAbout 4 months after the discharge, the patient presented with ventral hernia and requested reconstruction of the abdominal wall. Repair of ventral hernia by synthetic mesh application and reconstruction of the abdominal wall with flap cover was planned. Per-operatively the abdominal skin graft was separated from the peritoneum and the underlying omentum and an inlay composite mesh was applied to secure the abdominal wall []. The graft was not de epithelialised. It was carefully separated from the peritoneum over the bowels. No perforation occurred. A free tensor fascia lata flap was applied over the mesh, but the flap failed. Then after debridement two random pattern transposition skin flaps, one from the right upper and another from the left lower abdomen were transposed over the abdominal wound and donor area was skin grafted []. Patient was discharged after 17 days with advice to wear an abdominal binder. He is presently in follow-up, it has been 18 months since surgery and there is no ventral hernia and abdominal wall is flat and intact. Patient is satisfied with the results [Figures and ].","{

"A previously healthy 73-year-old Caucasian female presents to the clinic with a history of progressive fatigue and dyspnea on exertion over the past couple of months. She denied angina, palpitations, syncope or any other associated symptoms and did not have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. On examination, she was stable and in no distress. Her blood pressure was 148/66 mmHg with a regular pulse of 48 beats per minute. She had no clinical evidence of heart failure on cardiovascular examination but was found to have an S4 on auscultation and cannon A waves on assessment of her jugular venous pressure (JVP). Her exam was otherwise unremarkable. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram during the clinic visit revealed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute with right bundle branch block morphology; her 12-lead electrocardiogram 3 months earlier also revealed evidence of underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm. Trans-thoracic echocardiography displayed normal left ventricular size and function with mild degenerative changes of the mitral and aortic valves consistent with age related changes. There was no laboratory evidence of any metabolic or ischemic etiologies for the conduction disease. Given her age, clinical presentation, underlying conduction disease in the setting of no significant structural abnormalities on echocardiography, and lack of significant comorbidities, the patient likely had age related degenerative conduction disease. Significant coronary artery disease could not be excluded but was very unlikely given the lack of ischemic symptoms and cardiovascular disease risk factors along with normal cardiac size and function. She was arranged to have a permanent pacemaker implant for the symptomatic complete heart block and will have further risk stratification for possible coronary artery disease following the pacemaker implantation.The patient was brought to the operating theater following informed consent. Initial venous access and lead implantation was attempted across the left cephalic vein but aborted due to difficulty in delivering the pacing lead into the right ventricular (RV) cavity; the venous trajectory was that of a persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) draining directly into the coronary sinus. Right cephalic venous access was subsequently obtained and to our surprise there was an anomalous venous trajectory on the right implantation side as well (Figure ); on intra-operative venography is was evident that the right brachiocephalic vein drained directly into the left persistent SVC as the patient had an absent right SVC (Figure ). Steering the right atrial (RA) pacing lead into the RA cavity was not very difficult however positioning it in the right atrial appendage required careful manipulation. Once in the RA cavity, the straight stylet of the RA pacing lead was exchanged for the curved “J” stylet and clock-wise torque was applied during further advancement of the lead to direct it anteriorly in the optimal atrial appendage position (Figure ). Positioning the RV pacing lead was a challenge since the pacing lead was gaining atrial access across the coronary sinus (CS) OS which is located very close to the RV inlet however the CS OS directs the lead away from the RV inlet towards the lateral free wall of the RA. We were able to redirect the RV pacing lead into the RV by reflecting its tip off the RA free wall thus looping the lead around into the RA and back into the RV (Figure ); in order to reflect the tip of the RV pacing lead off the RA free wall it is very important to withdraw the straight lead stylet back a few centimeters to ensure the tip of the lead is no longer stiff and thus reduce the risk of atrial perforation. Once across the tricuspid valve, the straight stylet can be advanced further if necessary to guide the pacing lead to the RV apex. Alternative methods that could be attempted to direct the RV pacing lead into the RV cavity in such complex anomalous venous anatomy includes adding significant distal curve to the lead stylet or using one of the curved long venous access sheaths that are typically used for CS OS canulation during cardiac-resynchronization therapy device implantation.\nFollowing pacemaker implantation, the patient was monitored overnight in the cardiac telemetry unit and discharged home the following day. Her symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion resolved following device implant.\nIn this case report, we document our pacemaker implantation technique in a patient with a very rare venous anomaly involving an absent right and persistent left superior vena cava.\nVenous anomalies of the thorax can occur in isolation or association with congenital heart disease (CHD). A persistent left SVC (Figure ) can be identified incidentally in 0.5% of the general population and 4% of patients with CHD. Typically when present the left SVC is alongside a smaller caliber right SVC and the left SVC is usually not associated with a brachiocephalic vein. In the incidental and benign setting, the left SVC drains directly into the coronary sinus; when draining directly into the left atrium, the persistent left SVC is usually associated with CHD with the most common being atrial septal defects and coarctation of the aorta [,].\nAnomalies of the right SVC can include drainage to the left atrium, low right atrial insertion, aneurysmal dilatation, and anomalous left brachiocephalic vein drainage to the right SVC []. Persistent left SVC with an absent right SVC is very uncommon in the general population and occurs in 0.07 to 0.13% of patients who have CHD with viscera-atrial situs solitus [].\nLong-term prognosis in abnormal SVC development is good in the absence associated CHD []. Venous anomalies however can make central venous access and in particular pacemaker lead implantation very challenging; this includes single and dual pacemaker implantation along with cardiac resynchronization therapy whereby the insertion of any lead (atrial, ventricular, or coronary sinus leads) would be challenging due to the unfamiliar venous course which does not conform with the pre-formed shapes of the venous access tools utilized during these procedures. These venous anomalies can also cause procedural challenges in any other types of thoracic and cardiac surgeries especially if the physician is not familiar with the course of the venous anomaly at hand along with other associated congenital abnormalities. Pre-operative imaging with venography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or agitated-saline contrast echocardiography can help identify cases of challenging venous anatomy allowing appropriate operative planning; careful patient selection is warranted given the risk of contrast nephrotoxicity.\nThe pacemaker lead implantation techniques we described above to overcome the challenges of this particular anomalous venous drainage case may not apply or be effective in all patients with similar or differing anatomy. It is therefore essential to evaluate the underlying venous anatomy at hand objectively using intra-operative venography or pre-operative imaging if possible when an anomalous anatomy is suspected. Once the anatomy is clarified, the technique that is the safest and least invasive for a particular scenario should be attempted first. Failure to implant pacing leads intravenously may warrant consideration for surgical epicardial lead implantation. In the setting of failed endocardial defibrillator lead implantation attempts, subcutaneous defibrillators can also be considered.","{

"An 88-year-old male presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered. The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Worsening pain of the left breast and left chest wall region', 'Recurrent palpable mass within the inferior aspect of the left breast'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Recurring left breast palpable mass with fibromatosis'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Mammogram', 'Finding': 'Scarring and tissue disorganization in the left breast'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Intensely enhancing lesion in the inferior-lateral aspect of the left breast'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': '5.2 cm mass within the inferior-lateral aspect of the left chest wall'}, {'Test': 'Core biopsy', 'Finding': 'Diagnosis of fibromatosis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Fibromatosis (Desmoid tumor)', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Left breast and chest wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Left total mastectomy, en bloc resection of musculature and chest wall structures', 'Details': 'Closure with 2-mm DualMesh Gore-Tex patch'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '22 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient remains disease free'}}}"
"A 43-year-old man presented with a progressive deterioration of visual function for the previous seven years. The patient had no other ocular symptoms such as nystagmus or photophobia. His past history showed stable vision of 20 / 40 since trauma to his right eye when he was approximately 14 years of age. No other systemic abnormalities or malformations were recorded. His best-corrected vision was 20 / 400 in the right eye and 20 / 20 in the left, and his intraocular pressures were 25 mmHg in the right eye and 23 mmHg in the left eye at the time of his initial visit. Under slit lamp examination, a diffuse haze composed of a flaky pattern of stroma was noted throughout the entire cornea. The right eye had decreased vision and exhibited relatively denser homogenous opacities than the left ().\nThe family members stated that corneal changes had been detected only in the patient's mother at 69 years of age, and no specific issues had arisen in any other family member or relative. The patient's father had reported no ophthalmic abnormalities before his death, and his mother had been diagnosed with diffuse corneal opacities of unknown etiology in both eyes three years previously (). She explained that she had experienced decreased vision since childhood, but these deficiencies produced no difficulties in her daily life. The patient's brother and sister had no symptoms at all and no ophthalmic or systemic abnormalities. As far as the family knew, no one in the paternal or maternal lineage or offspring of the patient had experienced any eye problems except for the patient's mother ().\nThe endothelium and Descemet's membrane of the right eye were identified as normal following slit lamp examination. No gross abnormalities, such as Haab's striae or features of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy, were detected in the right eye. The patient's past medical records from another hospital demonstrated that his endothelial cells of both eyes presented with a normal shape and numbers under a specular microscope about six years ago. However, endothelial cells were found as indeterminate forms using specular microscopy due to the barrier of stromal opacity at the time of our study. The endothelial cells of the left eye were counted using a Konan Noncon Robo-8400 noncontact specular microscope (Konan Medical Inc., Hyogo, Japan) as 2564 cells/m2. We assumed that the right eye would have a similar amount of endothelial cells and a relatively uniform morphologic pattern as those of the left.\nUltrasound corneal pachymetry (Humphrey Instruments Inc., San Leandro, CA, USA) revealed a central corneal thickness of 658 µm in the right eye and 632 µm in the left. The patient was suspicious for CHSD based upon clinical evidence, and he was scheduled for penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye. A corneal button was sent for light and electron microscopic analysis. There was no problem with corneal wound healing after keratoplasty, and the grafted cornea restored its transparency within two weeks. After 12 months, the corneal graft remained clear, and the patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 50 in the right eye.\nLight microscopy with hemotoxylin and eosin staining revealed a normal epithelium and uninterrupted Bowman's membrane. The stromal lamellae were separated slightly from one another, forming a relatively compact space in between the anterior and the posterior stroma (). No Descemet's membrane or endothelium was detected in the original corneal button, apparently as the result of inappropriate specimen handling. Any infiltration, vessels, inflammatory, or storage material could not be detected.\nElectron microscopy revealed a criss-crossing pattern of corneal collagen fibers with a relatively electron dense and lucent structure and collagen fibers irregular in shape and size (). Keratocytes extended widely through the zone of low filaments ().\nBlood was sampled from the patient and family members for DNA collection and analysis []. DNA sequencing analysis of the decorin gene in chromosome 12q22 was positive in both the patient and his mother. The novel mutation of a heterozygous, nucleoside substitution (c.1036T>G) point mutation in the decorin gene was detected in both patients (). Lumican and keratocan sequence variants, which are closely located within the decorin gene, did not reveal any mutations. The c.1036T>G mutation resulted in a change of amino acid sequence (p.Cys346Gly). However, no genetic mutations were detected in other family members.","{

"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Anterior shoulder dislocation after ski fall'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Compressive hematoma in axillary region, disruption of axillary artery flow, bilateral pulmonary embolism'}, {'Test': 'Arteriography', 'Finding': 'Disruption of axillary artery with extravasation of contrast near humeral head'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Anterior shoulder dislocation with associated vascular injury', 'Type': 'Traumatic injury', 'Location': 'Shoulder region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Reduction of shoulder dislocation, vascular management', 'Details': 'Successful reduction in operating room, thromboembolectomy, angioplasty balloon insertion, end-to-end anastomosis'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No neurological or vascular complications reported', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Partial functional disability likely due to distal brachial plexus stunning'}}}"

"A 81-year old woman was referred to our department to evaluate a wound dehiscence on her left knee with hardware exposure. The patient did not have any relevant comorbidities and her general status was good. The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.\nAn X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.\nIn the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Our first decision was to cover the defect with a lateral gastrocnemius flap, however, the surrounding area was highly scarred, and the gastrocnemius muscle was found to be very atrophic and no suitable to fit the large defect. shows no other local flaps to be large enough to cover the whole defect, so we opted for a free flap.\nA lack of receptor vessels was evidenced, descending genicular artery was dissected, but small caliber and calcified plaques in the lumen discarded this option. With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap. Drainages were retained until output was less than 30 ml per day.\nWound healing properly evolved as well as the patient started rehabilitation during admission. The patient received Daptomycin (700 mg/d iv) and fosfomycin (2 g/6h iv) during 6 weeks, according to the infectious medicine protocol. The patient started walking uneventfully with a walking frame one month after surgery. The patient was enrolled in an outpatient rehabilitation program with close monitoring. At present time, the patient is able to ambulance without the need of assistant devices and there are no signsor symptoms of infection recurrence.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Increasing right knee pain and functional debility'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'History of osteochondritis dissecans with multiple past surgical interventions'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-Ray', 'Finding': 'Early degenerative change with intercondylar notch osteophytes consistent with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Marked abnormality over the weightbearing portion of the medial femoral condyle, subchondral cyst successfully debrided and grafted'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Osteochondritis dissecans', 'Type': 'Degenerative joint disease', 'Location': 'Medial femoral condyle'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Adipose derived MSC therapy', 'Details': 'Harvested and expanded autologous MSCs injected into the intra-articular space'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Self-limited flare up initially, followed by improvement in pain and functional scores', 'DischargeStatus': 'Successful'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Significant improvement in knee function and quality of life'}}}"
"This is a 39-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft in 2009 and percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting in 2008 to the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery. Patient also has hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism. He presented to the emergency department complaining of substernal chest pain associated with dizziness and shortness of breath. This occurred once to two times a week. His last stress test was in 2013 which was insignificant. One month ago he saw his cardiologist who recommended using nitroglycerin more frequently. His chest pain initially improved but for the past week his pain was increasing in severity and radiating to the left shoulder. Patient denied any nausea, vomiting, sweating, or loss of consciousness. The chest pain was not aggravated or alleviated by position or medication. Vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was normal including cardiac and neurological exam. The patient was seen by the cardiac team and was scheduled for a cardiac catheterization.\nA cardiac catheterization was performed which did not show any narrowing or disease of vessels. His ejection fraction was 65% and the previous grafts and stent were patent. The cardiac team cleared the patient for discharge. The patient was scheduled for discharge, however he suddenly developed left-sided weakness and facial droop. NIH stroke scale was 9. The rapid response team was called and the patient underwent a CT scan with no contrast which showed no evidence of any acute or significant intracranial abnormality and no bleeding. Patient was transferred to the ICU and the neurology team was consulted. Neurology recommended the use of tPA as the patient was within the window period for use. While reviewing the guidelines and contraindications, it was discovered that the patient's aPTT was higher than the upper normal limit due to the recent use of unfractionated heparin for cardiac catheterization. At this time, the primary team made the decision to recheck the aPTT after one hour since the patient was still within the therapeutic window for tPA. The repeat aPTT was reported in the normal range, making the patient eligible for thrombolysis. The patient tolerated this intervention well and hemoglobin remained stable throughout hospital course. MRI was done 24 hours after the intervention showed evidence of acute ischemic changes involving the right anterior parietal lobe in the region of the right postcentral gyrus. On discharge, the patient's left-sided weakness and facial droop improved significantly. His NIH stroke scale was only 1 on discharge. The patient was discharged home in stable condition on aspirin and statin, as per neurology recommendations with close follow-up as an outpatient.","{

"A 40-year-old dominant right-handed male working in private insurance company with no significant medical history suffered a distal radius fracture of the left hand due to road traffic accident (). On clinical examination, he could move the fingers of the hand and there was no evidence of any neurovascular deficit distal to the injury. Crepitus could be felt in the distal part of the radius just proximal to wrist joint and movements around the wrist were painful and limited. There were no other associated injuries, and medical history was not significant for any medical illness. A clinical diagnosis of the fracture of lower end radius was made and radiographs were consistent with the clinical diagnosis. Radiographs showed a comminuted fracture of the distal third radius with intra-articular extension for which open reduction and internal fixation through a volar FCR approach was planned. He underwent the definitive treatment of open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures distal radius under regional anesthesia. We had planned to fix the distal radius fracture using the usual FCR approach using 3.5 mm distal end radius locking plate. We could not identify the absence of the FCR tendon preoperatively because of severe swelling of the distal forearm. The incision was made at its usual location and we identified one tendon in the superficial plane which we thought was FCR, but when we traced the tendon proximally it started thinning without any muscle belly and when traced distally to its attachment, it was confirmed to be tendon of palmaris longus (PL). We could not find any tendon between PL and the traced radial artery. At that stage, we realized that FCRL was absent in that patient. We wrongly identified the PL tendon as the FCR because it was the tendinous structure at the most radial location of the volar distal forearm. When we found the median nerve just radial to the PL tendon, we were then able to identify the anatomical abnormality described in this case and immediate post-operative X-ray (-). Therefore, we changed the approach to the classic Henry’s approach after we had identified and gently protected the PCB. When we exposed and protected the radial artery through the same incision, we exposed the flexor pollicis longus (FPL), this must be retracted ulnarly, after the FPL is bluntly retracted, the pronator quadratus (PQ) is seen and incise the radial and distal borders of the PQ, elevating the muscle off the volar radius and fixed the fracture rigidly using a 3.5 mm distal end radius locking plate Nebula (stainless steel), Amritsar, Punjab, India.\nFour months after the operation, the patient had no pain or neurologic problems and complete bone union of the distal radius fracture. The patient returned to his work without any disability. We checked for the existence of an FCR tendon in the opposite forearm and could identify the thick FCR tendon by palpation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInfection': 'Patient developed swelling as a result of an infection three months previously'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical Examination', 'Finding': 'Severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation, submandibular lymphadenopathy'}, {'Test': 'Radiographic Examination', 'Finding': 'Deep caries cavity, radiolucent area in apical region of right mandibular first molar tooth, lamellar appearance on external cortical surface of mandible'}, {'Test': 'Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)', 'Finding': 'Tunnel-like defect in cortical bone, bone deposition at radiolucent area in lower edge of mandible'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': ""Garre's osteomyelitis"", 'Type': 'Inflammatory bone disease', 'Location': 'Right mandibular first molar region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Dental extraction', 'Details': 'Surgical removal of infected tooth'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Bone contours returned to normal, asymmetry of face disappeared, cortical bone thickness decreased and remodeled'}}}"
"A fourty-year-old man with DEB diagnosed at the age of eight was admitted to the department of gastroenterology because of the dysphagia for two previous months. The diagnosis of DEB was established due to the presence of single blisters on the whole body since the sixth month of life. His sister was also diagnosed with DEB and had similar symptoms of the disease. To our knowledge, the presented patient and his sister are the oldest diagnosed with EB living in Poland. At the age of four the patient started experiencing heartburn occasionally. Five years later dysphagia appeared for the first time. It was an episodal and periodical ailment. He reported a deterioration of dysphagia at the age of nineteen; he mostly consumed liquids and soft consistency meals during that time. Nonetheless, the patient admitted that this esophageal discomfort still was not a constant one and there were time intervals without this ailment. In the past there were also episodes of mild esophageal bleeding. The only one endoscopic esophageal dilatation in this patient took place in 1997; a stenosis was located then approximately 18 cm from incisors. The performed procedure ameliorated swallowing difficulty. A barium swallow test obtained one year after the endoscopic dilatation of the esophagus also revealed esophageal constriction on the same level. In 2014 the patient was diagnosed because of hematochezia and pain in hypogastrium. Tissue samples obtained in colonoscopy revealed the presence of nonspecific inflammatory infiltration in the ascending colon and terminal part of the ileum. Interestingly, 3 years ago he complained of hemoptysis and there was a suspicion of bleeding to pulmonary alveoli in the course of DEB. However, a CT scan did not confirm bleeding. On admission to our department the patient was complaining of painful swallowing of solids. Two months earlier he was diagnosed in the cardiology unit because of the chest pain and elevated level of troponin I. An electrocardiogram did not show any abnormalities. The patient refused to undergo coronarography and no more cardiological diagnostic procedures were performed Additional file . On admission to our unit he did not complain of the chest pain. On physical examination he appeared comfortable, afebrile with pulse 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 per minute and the body mass index (BMI) was 24.7 kg/m2. The patient presented blisters, skin reddening and crust formation on the upper and lower limbs. There were also contractures and disabled movement in his hand joints together with a loss of a finger and toenails (Fig. ). The apex of the tongue and left palatine arch were covered by superficial ulcerations. During his hospital stay, performed laboratory tests did not reveal any abnormalities. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed a thickening of the esophageal wall at maximum to 7 mm on the level from the fourth cervical vertebra to the fourth thoracic vertebra (Fig. ). A probe of gastroscopy under sedation with benzodiazepine failed due to an esophageal stenosis. An attempt of examination with paediatric endoscope was also unsuccessful. A barium swallow test revealed a narrowing of upper esophageal lumen to 7 mm along the length of 4 cm together with two diverticula on the right side not emptying of contrast. During swallowing other two diverticula appeared which were emptying of contrast (Fig. ). A barium swallow test also showed a noticeable weakening of the esophageal mucous membrane. After the performed investigation the patient was qualified to endoscopic dilatation of esophageal stenosis and endoscopic management of diverticula. However, he did not agree to undergo this procedure during current hospital stay. In our unit the patient was treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and prokinetic drugs administered intravenously, which caused an amelioration of esophageal discomfort. He was discharged in a good general condition with a recommendation of a diet based on soft consistency meals, oral PPI and prokinetic drugs administration and the next follow-up in a month.","{

"An 88-year-old man was transferred from a referring hospital for descending thoracic aortic injury after attempted pacemaker placement; 3 days prior he was admitted with a transient ischemic attack. He had new onset atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia that prompted pacemaker placement. Left subclavian access was attempted after a pocket was created. After placement of a five French sheath, arterial blood return was noted. The sheath was left in place and the procedure was aborted. The patient was hemodynamically stable and taken to computed tomography (CT) scanner for evaluation of arterial injury. The CT scan revealed direct cannulation of the aortic knob with the sheath. The patient was directly transferred by helicopter to our institution for higher level of vascular surgery care. The patient arrived intubated and sedated with the sheath in place in the left chest covered with a dressing and a left chest tube in place with 100cc of sanguinous output.\nThe patient was taken to the hybrid operating room in our facility. Bilateral percutaneous femoral access was obtained and a five French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery, and initially, a seven French sheath was placed in the left common femoral artery. We placed two proglide devices in the left access in standard preclose technique as this was our anticipated side of device deployment. At this point, a pigtail catheter was advanced into the ascending aorta and an arch aortogram was performed which demonstrated a direct cannulation of the aortic knob (). We elected to proceed to with stent graft placement to manage this injury as the patient’s comorbidities and advanced age were prohibitive risks for open repair. Prior to the placement of an endoprosthesis, a cerebral angiogram was performed to identify cerebrovascular dominance. This demonstrated a dominant right vertebral artery and left vertebral atresia. There was adequate distance from the site of sheath insertion to the left subclavian artery, such that we felt we could achieve a seal without covering the left subclavian artery. Based on our preoperative measurement of our anticipated proximal and distal seal zones, the aortic diameter was 32 mm. Therefore, we selected a 36 mm × 160 mm Valiant thoracic aortic stent graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) and advanced and deployed the device distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The sheath was removed from the aorta and the device was deployed simultaneously. Angioplasty was then performed with a Coda compliant balloon. Repeat arch and thoracic angiography revealed successful sealing of the injury site and no evidence of extravasation. Additionally, the left subclavian remained patent (). We removed the 24 French sheath from the left femoral access and successfully closed the arteriotomy with the proglide devices. The right groin access was managed with direct pressure. The patient had an uneventful post-operative course. The chest tube output was minimal and serous the remainder of his hospitalization and was removed on post-operative day 4. He was discharged to home on post-operative day 5 ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region', 'Developed swelling due to infection three months previously', 'Referred to clinic after unsuccessful antibiotic treatment'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInfection': 'Referred case, passed or congenital disease not specified'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical Examination', 'Finding': 'Severe swelling without fluctuation, submandibular lymphadenopathy'}, {'Test': 'Radiographic Examination', 'Finding': 'Deep caries cavity and radiolucent area in apical region of right mandibular first molar tooth, lamellar appearance on external cortical surface of mandible'}, {'Test': 'Cone-beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)', 'Finding': 'Tunnel-like defect in cortical bone, bone deposition at radiolucent area, focal new bone formation'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': ""Garre's osteomyelitis"", 'Type': 'Secondary osteomyelitis', 'Location': 'Right mandibular first molar tooth'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Dental extraction', 'Details': 'Considered as most appropriate treatment method'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Bone contours returned to normal, facial asymmetry disappeared, cortical bone thickness decreased and remodeled'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Four months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient showed improvement post-surgery'}}}"
"A 40-year-old Asian woman who had been in her usual state of good health was incidentally found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung during a regular medical checkup. The patient was seen in the department of medicine of our hospital for further evaluation. The patient’s family history was noncontributory, and a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The results of laboratory studies were either within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, as well as a small nodule (1.2 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. ). The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples. The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.\nFive years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging also revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra. To evaluate both the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed. The orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. They also found that the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal. During the clinical course (105 months), no significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were found, even with imaging examinations, including CT and MR imaging. The patient made good postoperative progress and remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation.\nThe resected specimen of the lung contained a well-circumscribed solid lesion 13 mm in diameter. It was composed of fascicular architecture of bland spindle or polygonal cells (Fig. ). Neither necrotic foci nor mitotic figures were observed. The tumor was immunopositive for epithelial membrane antigen (Fig. ), D2-40, progesterone receptor, vimentin, and S100 but negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin. Although curettage specimens from the vertebral bone were fragmented, the morphological and immunohistochemical findings were identical to those of the pulmonary lesion (Fig. ). The tumor was shown to be a transitional meningioma on histological examination, including immunohistochemical analyses (Table ).","{

"A 84-year-old female was scheduled for bilateral total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis of both hips (). Medical history included chronic Hepatitis C virus infection with no other medical conditions reported. The patient was allowed to decide which hip would be performed first. 5 months after scheduling, the patient was admitted for surgery arriving in a wheelchair, and new pelvis radiographs were taken (). Other causes of the rapid destruction of the hip joint were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed of bilateral RDO. Keeping in mind a possible septic etiology, despite there was no history of septicemia and inflammatory markers were elevated due to chronic hepatitis, we decided to take samples for microbiology and histology during the procedures. The right hip was performed through an anterior approach by a senior surgeon following standard antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin 20 min before skin incision. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted with no complications. Femoral head destruction led to an important defect in the posterior and superior wall of the acetabulum. This conditioned high and medial implantation of the cup to achieve stability. 4 days after the first procedure was performed, one out of six cultures was positive for Enterococcus faecium with no local and systemic signs of infection or pain. Synovial biopsy revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no signs of acute inflammation. Urine cultures were negative. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria [] were not met and the patient did not receive antibiotic treatment. 6 days later, after a favorable post-operative evolution, the left hip was performed through a posterior approach by a different senior surgeon with the same hip system but with a cemented stem (). In the left hip, the acetabulum was also affected by the bone destruction, but the cup was able to be placed at a correct height. This ended up with a leg length discrepancy that is well tolerated by the patient taking into account her previous functional status. 5 days after the second procedure and following a post-operative period without complications, the patient was discharged before obtaining definitive microbiological results. Cement was loaded with gentamycin, and the same antibiotic prophylaxis protocol was used. For the second surgery, three out of four samples were positive for the same microorganism. 2 weeks later, the patient was readmitted due to wound drainage of the right hip. Surgical debridement and irrigation with the exchange of the modular components were performed. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started with teicoplanin, amikacin, and rifampicin according to the Infectious Diseases Department’s protocol at our institution. Amikacin was stopped 3 days after surgery because no Gram-negative Bacilli were isolated. All four samples obtained during the debridement were positive for E. faecium 5 days after surgery with identical sensitivity tests as for the first hip. Pathogen-specific antibiotic treatment was then started with amoxicillin and rifampicin. 2 weeks after debridement and 1 month after the first surgery, the patient was again readmitted due to wound drainage of the same right hip. Again, surgical debridement and exchange of modular components were performed continuing with the same antibiotic treatment. For the second debridement, one out of five samples was positive for Propionibacterium acnes. Amoxicilin treatment was followed during 3 months. At 18 months after surgery, the patient had recovered to previous full activity. Blood tests at 18 months showed normal C-reactive protein levels and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 40 mm/h. In the last X-ray control, there were no signs of loosening (). Patient regained complete gait independence without pain. No further complications were reported.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Recent chest X-ray showing a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung', 'History of malignant melanoma with lymph node metastasis in the left groin', 'Renal cell carcinoma in the right kidney with metastasis in the left kidney'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousTumors': ['Malignant melanoma on the right loin - radical excision performed', 'Lymph node metastasis in the left groin - chemotherapy received', 'Renal cell carcinoma in both kidneys - partial nephrectomy on the right, complete nephrectomy on the left']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest X-ray', 'Finding': 'Suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan of the chest', 'Finding': 'Inconclusive ruling out of metastasis'}, {'Test': 'MRI of the chest', 'Finding': 'Spherical tumour attached to the wall of the right atrium, diagnosed as benign lipoma'}, {'Test': 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'Finding': 'Mass in the right atrium confirmed'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Benign lipoma in the right atrium', 'Type': 'Mesenchymal tumor', 'Location': 'Right atrium'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical excision of lipoma and biopsy of lung mass', 'Details': 'Excision of lipoma through incision in right atrium, biopsy of lung mass performed'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged after 9 days with appointment for partial lobectomy'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Good prognosis expected for lipoma, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma diagnosed in lung mass'}}}"

The pacing leads and box were removed and the infection was treated with antibiotics. Due to subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection, transvenous approach for implantation of a new pacing system proved not to be feasible. Therefore he was referred for surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.\nA lower half limited median sternotomy was performed starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. A second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy (Figure ). The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle. The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle. Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall. It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle. The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested. A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle. The pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle, into the pacing box pouch and connected to the pacing box. Defibrillation threshold testing was performed, and the lowest effective threshold was found to be < 10 Jules. The sternum was approximated using interrupted stainless steel wires. Sternotomy and subcostal incisions were closed in layers. The patient had a good post operative recovery and was discharged home on day 4 after the operation. Follow-up studies showed well functioning biventricular pacing system, stable pacing lead positions (Figure ), good biventricular synchronized function, and no pericardial effusion.","{

"At the time of diagnosis this patient was a 9 year-old female with a one year history of pain and swelling about her left knee. She had experienced a fall and related all symptoms to the fall. She was seen in her local emergency room by her family physician; there was no diagnosis or treatment. Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space. She underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel array with 1 cm spacing. Radio-opaque clips were placed to delineate the tumor bed and assist in brachytherapy planning [Figure ]. The margins of the resection were involved with tumor, as demonstrated by field biopsies and assessment of the margins of resection. Satellite tumor nodules were present in the resection specimen. Four days after surgery the six afterloading catheters were loaded with 82 seeds representing 302 mCi of I125 (Figure). The dwell time of the implant was 62 hours and the patient received a total implant dose of 2480 cGy delivered at 40 cGy/hr. Two weeks later the patient began external beam irradiation at 180 cGy/day and received a course of treatment and total external beam dose of 5040 cGy using 6 MV photons with treatment delivered with two beams using a CT based treatment plan [Figure ]. Radiation therapy was completed in March 2000.\nThe patient suffered moist desquamation corresponding to the radiation therapy portal that was predicted based on the treatment and the use of a tissue equivalent bolus material which was placed on the wound on alternating days during her course of external beam irradiation. She was able to return home on the last day of treatment. On routine follow-up, only 4 months after treatment, left leg appearing to be slightly longer than her right leg by less than 1 cm. No corresponding gait problems were reported. Nearly one year after treatment (January 2000) physical examination showed good range of motion at the left knee; however, there was significant valgus angulation. An MR study was reviewed by Orthopedic Surgery and was noted to show growth arrest laterally and predominantly involving the distal femoral physis [Figure ]. Based on these findings, the family was informed that an epiphysiodesis of the distal femoral physis would likely be required to prevent additional deformity. Due to the angulatory deformity, an osteotomy of the distal femur would be required. Because of high-dose irradiation and concerns about bone healing, osteotomy and epiphysiodesis were deferred until the three year evaluation was performed. At that time, the patient had a significant valgus deformity. The morbidity of the deformity was such that ambulation was difficult. The patient underwent a closing wedge correcting osteotomy, which was fixed with a contour plate. The patient subsequently fractured the plate secondary to early and unprotected weightbearing (against medical advice). She was placed in a cast and ultimately healed her osteotomy. She continues to have a significant limb length discrepancy and will require future lengthening procedures. She remains without evidence of disease nearly 4 years after treatment.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region', 'Previous infection and unsuccessful antibiotic treatment'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInfection': 'Unknown passed or congenital disease specified'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographic examination', 'Finding': 'Deep caries cavity and radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth'}, {'Test': 'CBCT', 'Finding': 'Tunnel-like defect in cortical bone, bone deposition at radiolucent area, and lamellar appearance on external cortical surface of mandible'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': ""Garre's osteomyelitis"", 'Type': 'Inflammatory bone disease', 'Location': 'Right mandibular molar region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Dental extraction', 'Details': 'To remove the infected tooth and promote healing'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Bone contours returned to normal, facial asymmetry disappeared, cortical bone thickness decreased and remodeled'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Four months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient showed significant improvement post-surgery'}}}"
"A 81-year old woman was referred to our department to evaluate a wound dehiscence on her left knee with hardware exposure. The patient did not have any relevant comorbidities and her general status was good. The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.\nAn X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.\nIn the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Our first decision was to cover the defect with a lateral gastrocnemius flap, however, the surrounding area was highly scarred, and the gastrocnemius muscle was found to be very atrophic and no suitable to fit the large defect. shows no other local flaps to be large enough to cover the whole defect, so we opted for a free flap.\nA lack of receptor vessels was evidenced, descending genicular artery was dissected, but small caliber and calcified plaques in the lumen discarded this option. With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap. Drainages were retained until output was less than 30 ml per day.\nWound healing properly evolved as well as the patient started rehabilitation during admission. The patient received Daptomycin (700 mg/d iv) and fosfomycin (2 g/6h iv) during 6 weeks, according to the infectious medicine protocol. The patient started walking uneventfully with a walking frame one month after surgery. The patient was enrolled in an outpatient rehabilitation program with close monitoring. At present time, the patient is able to ambulance without the need of assistant devices and there are no signsor symptoms of infection recurrence.","{

"A 54-year-old woman with a history of large goiter and liver function abnormalities was referred by her physician to the CAMC to address her multiple dietary supplement use. She was noted to have moderate liver function abnormalities (ALT 3 times normal range) during a medical evaluation. After extensive evaluation of her liver dysfunction no apparent causes were found. She did not drink alcohol or take any medications, and was of normal body weight. Infectious, obstructive and autoimmune causes were ruled out. She was noted to consume a number of dietary supplements and referred to our clinic to address dietary supplement polyherbacy and its potential affect on her liver function tests. She brought all her supplements for review. At that evaluation, we addressed the purpose of her use of each supplement ().\nShe reported adding more and more dietary supplements over the years, as she read extensively and frequently researched the internet for information on these products. Ultimately she felt at a loss as to which supplements might be of benefit or which supplements to stop taking. This patient typically would use less than the recommended dose noted on the label, but at times would use a higher than recommended dose. She also would vary which supplement she might use in any given day. She expressed concern that her dietary supplement intake had gotten out of control and felt she may be addicted to using supplements as they gave her a greater sense of control.\nAfter discussing the purpose for using each dietary supplement and concerns with dietary supplement polypharmacy and its potential effect on her liver dysfunction, she agreed to stop all supplements for the time being, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, and one multivitamin a day. Until her follow-up visit she would increase her dietary intake of antioxidant foods, acidophilus and omega 3 fatty acids in place of her supplements, and practice mind-body techniques and exercise for health and stress reduction. We also offered a referral to counseling for anxiety management. Follow-up liver function tests were normal. We proposed to re-introduce a fewer number of supplements, based on evidence-based indications and safe dose ranges, one at a time, while we followed her liver function tests. She elected however to stay off the supplements over the next two follow-up visits, as she was happy with her dietary modifications. Based on the evidence presented above, we believe that her abnormal liver function tests were a result of excessive supplement use and resolved completely with withdrawal of offending agents.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe swelling and facial asymmetry in the right mandibular molar region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInfection': 'Patient developed swelling due to infection three months prior'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical Examination', 'Finding': 'Severe swelling without fluctuation and submandibular lymphadenopathy'}, {'Test': 'Radiographic Examination', 'Finding': 'Deep caries cavity and radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth'}, {'Test': 'CBCT', 'Finding': 'Tunnel-like defect in cortical bone in vestibule surface and bone deposition in radiolucent area'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': ""Garre's osteomyelitis"", 'Type': 'Inflammatory bone disease', 'Location': 'Right mandibular region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Dental extraction', 'Details': 'Removal of the infected right mandibular first molar tooth'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Bone contours returned to normal, facial asymmetry disappeared, and cortical bone remodeled'}}}"
"The 32-year-old female was referred to the center for vascular consultation. The patient was a house wife and a mother of two children. She reported having an episode of sudden onset severe headache associated with generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness. She regained consciousness after a period of 24 h without any neurological deficit with a complaint of neck rigidity and headache. The patient had a past history of similar episodes dating back 1 year. Upon interview she recalled a long history of trivial headaches, malaise and low grade fever for the past 6 years, whose severity had never warranted any further investigation. She also had a history of intermittent claudication in her bilateral upper limbs. Physical examination revealed no neurological deficit, however, radial and brachial arteries were impalpable bilaterally. Right to left blood pressure discrepancies were detected, measuring at 140/80 from right arm and 160/80 from the left arm.\nA CT brain was conducted that revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension (). Similar findings were evident in previous CT scan brain which was done 1 year ago at the previous presentation of ictus (). Laboratory investigation showed raised ESR upto 40 mm/h and C Reactive Protein was positive. Cerebral angiography and aortogram showed total occlusion of left common carotid artery from its origin and 90% occlusion of right common carotid artery from its origin with slightly dilated segment prior to its tapering (). The sole arteries supplying the intracranial circulation were bilateral vertebral arteries and showed saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm (). Additional imaging showed bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries from their initial segments. There were extensive collateral branches to intercostal arteries supplying both upper arms (). The terminal aorta was irregular but bilateral renal arteries and other branches of aorta were normal (). We started the patient on 20 mg prednisone resulting in a reduction of ESR as well as normalization of C Reactive Protein. Further the patient was referred for endovascular coil embolization as vertebral arteries were relatively straight and easy to access.\nCoil embolization procedure was decided as line of approach for therapy. The navigation was straightforward from vertebral artery but unfortunately the patient had complication and third episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage night before the procedure and expired.","{

"A 22 years old female patient reported to our department with a complaint of facial disfigurement on the left side of the face which gradually progressed over the past 14 years. Progressive atrophy on the left half of the face was initially noticed at the age of 8 years as an area of hyper pigmentation on the left malar area which gradually progressed with resultant atrophy of the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue resulting in the present disfigurement (Fig. ). However it was not associated with any other symptoms except for the limited mouth opening which the patient experienced gradually as the condition progressed. The patient had not sought any consultation earlier, for the facial disfigurement. Her medical and family history was non contributory. On general physical examination patient was conscious, oriented, a febrile, general condition was fair and vital signs were stable. Right side of the face appeared normal with marked facial asymmetry noted on left side. Head and neck examination confirmed the asymmetry with flattening, hyperpigmented, parchment like overlying skin. There was an evident loss of underlying fat, muscle and subcutaneous tissue giving a sunken in appearance. Thinning of the lips on the affected side with exposition of the teeth due to the corner of the mouth pulled to left side. Ocular examination and skin examination showed no abnormality with any evidence of lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of sensory or motor deficits on both sides. On palpation, the skin on the affected side was rigid with signs of sclerosis. TMJ on the affected side was tender with deviation to the left on mouth opening. Intraoral examination revealed normal moist mucosa but tense oral mucosa on the affected side. Tongue on the affected side showed marked atrophy on the left side with shift in the dorsal median fissure (Fig. ). Hard tissue examination revealed crowding of the teeth with shift in midline to the affected side and obliteration of the buccal and vestibular sulcus due to tense oral tissue. Upper and lower arch showed constriction of the arch with multiple carious teeth on left side. Based on history and clinical examination a preliminary diagnosis of hemifacial atrophy of the left side of the face was made. Routine blood investigation revealed values within normal range, Patient was negative for Anti nuclear Antibodies suggestive of absence of any auto immune disease. Biopsy specimen of the affected skin lesion showed sclerodermoid tissue reaction suggestive of morphic changes. Radiographic investigation of chest, lateral lumbosacral spine, terminal phalanges of long bone showed no abnormality. Orthopantamograph [OPG] revealed significant findings of asymmetry with thinning of the body of mandible with smaller condyle and coronoid process, short roots on affected side when compared to right side. Crowding and carious tooth was also noted (Fig.). Paranasal sinus view showed hypoplasia of the frontal and maxillary sinus. Posterio- anterior view revealed asymmetry of the jaws. Computed tomography [CT] scan revealed generalized atrophy of the soft tissue of the left hemi face resulting in asymmetry on the left side with deviated nasal septum and marked hypoplasia of the frontal and maxillary sinus. Computed Tomographic scan of brain was normal.\nCorrelating all the investigation with the patient’s history and clinical examination a final diagnosis of Parry Romberg Syndrome was established. Dental and reconstructive plastic surgery using autologous fat transplant was considered as part of the treatment.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaint of a hole in upper jaw for 2 years', 'Started as an erythematous patch and developed into a fistula'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Maxillary occlusal radiograph', 'Finding': 'Loss of bone from the mid palate region'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Palatal fistula', 'Type': 'Acquired condition', 'Location': 'Upper jaw, palate'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical closure with palatal rotational flap', 'Details': 'Excision of fistula margins, raising a partial thickness flap, rotation to cover the defect, and securing with sutures'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Healed without infection or dehiscence', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Two months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Healthy pink epithelium covering donor site, normal shape retained on hard palate'}}}"
"A 35 year old obese African American male, a mechanic by profession and no significant previous medical problems, came to the emergency room with left sided chest pain that started the night before and slowly got worse. By the time he reached the emergency room, the pain had reached 8 out of a maximum of10 in intensity. The pain was precipitated and aggravated by a stressful situation at home. It radiated to his left shoulder and was not relieved by rest. Patient had a five pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He would occasionally drink alcohol. On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been having mild left sided chest pains, sharp in nature and similar to the current episode, for the last few months. The pain would occur either with stress or exertion. He did not seek medical attention before because the pain would be transient and go away on its own after a few minutes. He was not on any medications and did not use any pain relieving medicines either for his prior symptoms.\nIn the emergency room, patient was in mild distress and had a blood pressure of 165/81, something new for him. All the rest of the vital signs were normal and both the cardiac and pulmonary examination did not reveal any abnormality either. The basic laboratory work up was normal except a lipid profile showing elevated cholesterol of 238 mg/dl. The patient had an electrocardiogram that showed some premature supraventricular complexes without any ischemic changes. Cardiac biomarkers including serial troponin-I were also normal. The chest pain subsided in the emergency room with intravenous morphine. The patient was admitted to the hospital in the telemetry unit. He was found to have some runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia while in the hospital. He underwent a cardiac exercise stress test and an echocardiogram which revealed that patient had a normal ejection fraction but a dilated left atrium along with apical wall motion abnormality.\nPatient then underwent a cardiac catheterization. It did not show any obstruction in the coronary arteries, but did reveal a ""tumor blush"" with neovascularization seen projecting from the left circumflex artery to the ""tumor blush"". (Figure ) Following the cardiac catheterization, patient had a CT scan of the chest to evaluate for any mass or tumor. The CT scan showed a 6 cm solid and likely necrotic mass beginning slightly anterior to the carina and extending caudally posterior to the left atrium. (Figure ) No prior imaging was available for comparison.\nAs it was still unclear whether the mass was originating intrinsic or extrinsic to the heart, so to define it better anatomically, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed. The TEE also showed the large mass, likely extrinsic to the heart, compressing the left atrium. (Figure ) Finally, the patient underwent an open heart surgery for definitive diagnosis and management. During surgical exploration, an extremely hard mass was found on the dome of the left atrium, and on further exploration, the indurated tissue clearly extended to the left atrial appendage, underneath the superior vena cava and past the origin of the right superior pulmonary vein. Frozen sections of the biopsy from the tumor were suggestive of ""Cardiac Paraganglioma"", showing tumor cells arranged in a nest-like (Zellballen) pattern-separated by thin vascular network. (Figure ) This was later confirmed further with special staining. The patient's tumor was initially deemed unresectable, because of its location and local invasion, by the operating surgeon and the median sternotomy incision was closed. However, patient then had a second opinion by a different surgeon who successfully resected the tumor and the patient recovered from the operation without any major complications. His normetanephrine levels which were very elevated before the tumor resection (1447 microgram/24 hours), normalized to 312 microgram/24 hours (normal value 110–620 microgram/24 hours) after the tumor was resected. Five years later he is doing well with no recurrence of the tumor, though he has to use a thiazide diuretic for blood pressure control.","{

"A 45-year-old man was presented in our department with a large, painful swelling in the popliteal fossa in his left leg. There has been a puncture wound by a nail 11 years ago and he resorted to another hospital. At that institution, medical treatment was given in accordance with the patient's momentary condition. Nevertheless, a slowly growing mass occurred in his popliteal fossa in a year following being subjected to the puncture wound. He resorted to cardiovascular surgery department in another hospital and Doppler ultrasonography together with arteriography was taken. A popliteal pseudoaneurysm was detected in the distal part of the popliteal artery near the bifurcation to the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and was about 4 cm in diameter (). The patient was taken into operation by cardiovascular surgeons after the angiography. He had an excision of the pseudoaneurysm and primary repair surgery to popliteal artery. After surgery, the popliteal artery was patent according to Doppler USG. He had a foot drop after the operation which resolves spontaneously after a year. At early follow-up, a gradually expanding mass recurred in the popliteal fossa. He went to cardiovascular surgery with this complain, but observation was recommended. Monophasic flow was seen on the popliteal artery according to Doppler ultrasonography which was taken 5 years after the operation. He resorted to some medical centers for his swelling to be treated during 10 years after bypass surgery, but observation without any interference was suggested according to the patient's momentary condition. He applied to our department with a huge popliteal mass associated with obstructed popliteal artery.\nOn the physical examination of the patient, there was a large mass (28 × 10 cm) in the popliteal fossa with old surgical scars. The lesion was soft, fluctuant, and painless in palpation (). The neurological examination of the lower leg was normal. The blood tests were normal. In the arteriography images, the popliteal artery occluded in the proximal section but was filled in the distal section with collateral vessels (). The MRI scan revealed an enormous soft tissue mass of 115 × 107 × 196 cm in size between the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius with the features compatible with hematoma with lobulation ().\nThe mass is excised from the adhered tibia protecting the nerve and the collateral vessels with hockey stick incision on the popliteal fossa on prone position (). There was about 1,5 L of chocolate-brown fluid evacuated from a well-defined wall and a multilocular cyst-like appearance was seen. The findings we gathered from the operation were compatible with a large fibrous cavity with villous formation containing a considerable quantity of altered blood clot (). A complete resection of the pseudocapsule was performed. The underlying fascia was extendedly sutured with the subcutaneous tissue, in order to avoid any dead space where new hematoma can develop. The liquid and soft tissue culture was sterile. The histopathological examination revealed abundant fibrous tissue with the features of hemorrhage. After one year from the surgical treatment, the patient has not shown any sign of recurrence ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Congenital anomaly of two upper limbs on the right side', 'Hypoplastic limbs compared to the left side', 'Limited functionality in both limbs'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalCondition': 'Congenital anomaly of upper limbs'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Hypoplastic scapula, shoulder joint with elbow joint synostosis'}, {'Test': 'Color Doppler Study', 'Finding': 'Duplication of right subclavian artery, patent radial and ulnar arteries'}, {'Test': 'MR Angiography', 'Finding': 'Confirmation of color Doppler findings, duplication of subclavian vessels'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Congenital limb abnormality', 'Type': 'Anomaly', 'Location': 'Upper limbs on right side'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Limbs transfer surgery', 'Details': 'Transfer of the inferior limb to the superior forearm as a neurovascular island'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved hand function, reduced shoulder joint mobility'}}}"
"The patient is a 58-year old male who was being evaluated for inguinal hernia repair. His past medical history included CAD with prior stenting of the left circumflex artery, diabetes with a HbA1c of 5.7 and an 80-pack year smoking history. He reported a 37 kg unintentional weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea. In addition, he had exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates. He had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia, and this demonstrated severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was confirmed by mesenteric angiography which demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery (). This artery had a 90% orifice stenosis. With his cardiac history and symptoms, he underwent coronary angiography, which demonstrated significant left main and 3-vessel CAD (). Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.\nHe was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months. A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80–99% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50–79% right internal carotid artery stenosis. Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.\nThe patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day. After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft. The greater saphenous vein was harvested endoscopically. After this was performed, a midline laparotomy was performed, extending the sternotomy incision. Dissection was carried through the lesser sac until the supra-celiac aorta was identified. The supra-celiac aorta, celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery were dissected from surrounding tissues. The patient was then systemically heparinized to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of greater than 450 seconds, and following aortic and right atrial cannulation, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Normothermic conditions were maintained. The mesenteric bypass was then performed from the supra-celiac aorta to the celiac artery and SMA with a bifurcated Vascutek® 12 mm × 6 mm Gelsoft™ graft (Terumo Cardiovascular Group, Ann Arbor, MI) in an end-to-end fashion (). After completion of the mesenteric bypass, the patient was cooled to 34°C, and coronary artery bypass grafting was performed with saphenous vein grafts to the first diagonal, first obtuse marginal, second obtuse marginal and posterior descending coronary arteries followed by the left internal mammary artery graft to mid-left anterior descending artery (). He was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without inotropic support. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 236 minutes (90 minutes for the mesenteric revascularization), and aortic cross clamp time was 125 minutes, using a single clamp technique. After administration of protamine, drains were placed and the sternum and laparotomy incision were closed. The patient had an uncomplicated course with return of bowel function on post-operative day 3 and was discharged home on day 7 from the combined procedure. The patient was seen in follow-up at 30 and 90 days post-operatively and had no recurrent neurological, cardiac or mesenteric symptoms.","{

"A 75-year-old man was seen in our orthopedic outpatient clinic with osteoarthritis of the right knee. He experienced morning stiffness, pain on the medial side of his right knee after walking and he had difficulties with full flexion of his knee. Conservative treatment was started with steroid infiltration, 4 cc lidocaine mixed with 1 cc depomedrol. Besides these complaints the patient reported a bilateral painless swollen calf muscle. The patient had noticed these swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago without any traumatic history. He had no pain at night and no fever or medical illness. The past medical history of the patient was uneventful.\nOn physical examination the soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. A dimpling in both legs (right more than left) at the medial calf area was seen while standing (Figure ). There was full strength in all lower leg muscles and the reflexes were normal on examination. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, the overlying skin appeared normal without deformities, erythema or warmth and the arterial pulsations were intact. Laboratory test results did not show any abnormalities. An X-ray did not show any bony irregularities in the tibia.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the legs revealed bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle (Figure ). There was no nidus seen on MRI so an arteriovenous form of the malformation was not plausible. Due to its asymptomatic presentation no angiogram or ultrasonography was performed to further specify the lesion. After consultation of the vascular surgeon we did not perform surgical resection or focal sclerotherapy because of the asymptomatic nature of the lesions. After explanation of the possible muscle damage from resection and because of the fact that our patient had no disabilities in daily living, we agreed upon conservative management. At three mo follow up the swollen calf muscles were still asymptomatic and examination did not show any change of the venous malformations. We continued the conservative treatment focused on the osteoarthritis of the knee with good result.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Slight periodontal bleeding for 5 days'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalHistory': 'No history of cervicofacial trauma or coagulation disorders'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Orthopantomography', 'Finding': 'Doubtful periapical image, possible dental cyst'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Large arteriovenous malformation in mandibular body, pterygoid region, and infratemporal fossa'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Arteriovenous malformation', 'Type': 'Intraosseous', 'Location': 'Mandibular body, pterygoid region, and infratemporal fossa'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Endovascular embolization', 'Details': 'Embolization of main drainage vein and selective arterial vessels'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complete regression of lesion', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged 7 days post-procedure'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No signs of recurrence'}}}"
"A 81-year old woman was referred to our department to evaluate a wound dehiscence on her left knee with hardware exposure. The patient did not have any relevant comorbidities and her general status was good. The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.\nAn X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.\nIn the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Our first decision was to cover the defect with a lateral gastrocnemius flap, however, the surrounding area was highly scarred, and the gastrocnemius muscle was found to be very atrophic and no suitable to fit the large defect. shows no other local flaps to be large enough to cover the whole defect, so we opted for a free flap.\nA lack of receptor vessels was evidenced, descending genicular artery was dissected, but small caliber and calcified plaques in the lumen discarded this option. With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap. Drainages were retained until output was less than 30 ml per day.\nWound healing properly evolved as well as the patient started rehabilitation during admission. The patient received Daptomycin (700 mg/d iv) and fosfomycin (2 g/6h iv) during 6 weeks, according to the infectious medicine protocol. The patient started walking uneventfully with a walking frame one month after surgery. The patient was enrolled in an outpatient rehabilitation program with close monitoring. At present time, the patient is able to ambulance without the need of assistant devices and there are no signsor symptoms of infection recurrence.","{

"An 18-year-old American college football player presented with a vague headache since he was tackled during exercise several weeks ago. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed at a local hospital a few days before visiting our hospital because the headache worsened and was not relieved through medication. Initial brain CT revealed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity (). Few calcified nodules were noted at the left frontotemporal cortex. However, it was initially considered a simple traumatic hemorrhage and was managed by conservative means. Several days later, the headache aggravated and the patient experienced an episode of generalized partial seizure. On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed immediately after the seizure, the size of acute hematoma and cerebral edema was markedly increased, and a small enhancing mass was observed at the left cerebral convexity (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region (). Emergency craniotomy was performed to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma. A large craniotomy was done, and the subdural hematoma was removed by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision. While further opening of the dura, we were encountered by several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules which were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain (). Upon careful dissection, these nodules were noted to be buried in the sulcus while being severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries. Between the nodules was an organizing hematoma and upon careful removal, a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch was exposed. The involved MCA branch was carefully dissected and was trapped by clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm. The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised. The ischemic injury was minimized because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery. The patient recovered without sequelae and was discharged after a short while.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe left calf pain for 10 years, worsened with menstruation, standing or walking for more than 30 min, relieved by elevating leg or massaging calf muscles'], 'MedicalHistory': {'None': 'No relevant or significant medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Intramuscular electrical stimulation and lidocaine injections', 'Finding': 'Ineffective'}, {'Test': 'Acupuncture and Korean herbal medications', 'Finding': 'Ineffective'}, {'Test': 'Conventional radiography', 'Finding': 'Mottled calcifications within muscles'}, {'Test': 'Femoral Angiography', 'Finding': 'Hemangioma in the left calf'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Enhancing soft-tissue mass in the medial aspect of the soleus muscle'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Intramuscular hemangioma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Soleus muscle'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Excisional biopsy', 'Details': 'Mass excised from soleus muscle, final diagnosis confirmed as intramuscular hemangioma with fatty overgrowth'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': '90% pain relief within 1 month, discontinued all pain medications, resumed mountain hiking after 3 months'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Subject able to resume activities without calf pain'}}}"
"An 82-year-old male presented with a large right IIA aneurysm diagnosed during routine surveillance on a long background history of complicated aortoiliac endovascular intervention. His comorbidities included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. He had undergone an endovascular AAA repair 9 years previously for treatment of a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. This treatment was complicated by the subsequent development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. In attempting to endovascularly repair these aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, a rupture of the right external iliac artery necessitated placement of a covered stent across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft. Ongoing surveillance of his aortoiliac system with duplex ultrasound demonstrated the gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms. A dedicated CT angiogram performed 6 years after the IIA origin was covered showing the sac having expanded to a diameter 6.4 cm. The source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in left iliac system. Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left sided femoral artery puncture, with angiography demonstrating the origin of the endoleak being the right superior gluteal artery that was being fed through a plexus of collateral channels through the body of the sacrum. It was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, and therefore endovascular treatment of the endoleak was not possible. The patient was offered an open procedure to manage the enlarging IIA aneurysm, which was declined due to the significant risks in light of the patient's previous abdominal interventions and poor overall health ().\nThe decision was made to treat the aneurysm via direct puncture method employing a posterior approach under CT visualisation. Under general anaesthetic and with the patient in a prone position, CT guidance was used to insert a 17-gauge needle into the right superior gluteal artery. The artery was accessed via a transgluteal approach with the catheter passing through the sciatic notch. Contrast injection in the angiography suite confirmed the catheter to be situated in the right superior gluteal artery distal to the site of the endoleak. Angiography demonstrated five branches leading from the sacral body, feeding the gluteal artery, and perfusing the aneurysmal sac. These branches were selectively cannulated with a microcatheter and embolised with a variety of Interlock (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), Nestor (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA), and Target embolism coils (Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA). Subsequent contrast injection showed only filling of the sac with no further feeding collaterals identified.\nFollowing successful embolisation of all collateral vessels, the main aneurysm sac was then injected with a liquid embolic agent, 1.5 mL of Lipidiol (Guerbet Group, Roissy, France), and 0.5 mL of Histoacryl (Tissue Seal, Ann Arbor, MN, USA). Completion angiography demonstrated no perfusion of the IIA aneurysm sac. Follow-up imaging demonstrated a stable aneurysm excluded from circulation. The patient made an uneventful recovery.","{

"A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital from a local clinic for decreased visual acuity in her left eye. Two hours before the manifestation of symptoms, an autologous fat injection was administered in the periocular area under intravenous anesthesia. The autologous fat was obtained from the abdominal area and the procedure was performed by a local plastic surgeon. When the effect of the anesthesia wore off, the patient reported a loss of vision in the left eye. The best corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and no light perception on the left side. The left pupil was dilated and a relative afferent pupillary defect was detected. During physical examination, the patient suddenly complained of dysarthria and the skin color of the nose changed to purple (). The patient was immediately transferred to the emergency room and neurological examination, blood tests, and an MRI scan of the brain were performed. Within 30 minutes, the dysarthria improved significantly and the patient was able to speak normally. On examination, the right fundus appeared to be normal but the left showed a cherry red spot with visible emboli in several retinal arteries (). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye revealed markedly prolonged choroidal filling around the optic disc and a delay in retinal arterial filling while that of the right eye revealed no abnormalities (). The results of laboratory examinations were normal, however the MRI scan showed an ill-defined hyperintense lesion at the left insular cortex (). The patient was finally diagnosed with ophthalmic artery obstruction and left middle cerebral artery infarction. The patient was promptly administered ocular massage, intravenous mannitolization, and oxygen and carbon dioxide therapy. Twenty-four hours after autologous fat injection, the left fundus exhibited marked retinal edema and multiple fat emboli and the visual acuity of the left eye was no light perception (). At 2 months after the injection, the patient had no perception of light in the left eye and the left fundus showed optic atrophy, multiple retinal hemorrhages, and a fibrous change on its posterior pole ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['37-year-old woman with ASD living with parents in Japan', 'Woman with ASD cared for her mother with end-stage breast cancer', 'Obstacles faced in caregiving role, daughter with ASD had difficulties managing care schedule', 'Daughter with ASD worked as an engineer but struggled with household chores and caregiving tasks'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Diagnosis': 'ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)', 'Details': 'Diagnosed in adulthood, parents not informed of diagnosis'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'N/A', 'Type': 'N/A', 'Location': 'N/A'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Consultation, social skill training', 'Details': 'Providing specific instructions, sharing behavioral traits with staff'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Improved communication, decreased stress and caregiving burden', 'DischargeStatus': 'N/A'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Seven months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved ability to communicate and manage caregiving tasks'}}}"
"A 55-year-old female presented to the ophthalmology department of the hospital with complaints of a painful swelling in the left eye. The swelling had been gradually increasing in size over the last 8 months with dull continuous pain in the eye and periorbital area. There was progressive diminution of vision for the last 6 months in the affected eye, and at the time of presentation in the hospital, the affected eye was completely blind. The progressive increase in the size of the swelling and pain in and around the eye compelled the patient to avail hospital services. The treatment history was not significant. The patient was being treated by a local doctor with eye drops and certain oral medicines the records of which were not available with her. She did not have any history of significant ocular disease or any ophthalmic surgery. There was no history of similar disease in the family.\nOn examination, an intraorbital mass protruding from the left eye was visible. Axial proptosis with stretched out sclera along with dilated blood vessels covering the entire exposed part of the eye ball was seen. The underlying cornea was barely visible through the widened palpebral aperture with hyperemic keratinized conjunctiva tissue. The swelling was more prominent in the region superior to the upper eye lid. The skin appeared stretched along with dilated vessels in the superior part of the eye ball []. On palpation, the mass was tender and soft in consistency. Fundus examination was not possible because of overlying vascularized keratinized tissue over cornea. The intraocular tension was also not recorded because of these reasons. The status of the pupil of the diseased eye could also not be commented upon, even though it appeared slightly dilated. The patient had no perception of light in the left eye. Ophthalmological examination of the right eye did not show any abnormality both in the anterior as well as in posterior chamber. The fundus examination of the right eye was normal. The intraocular tension of right eye was also normal.\nSystemic examination of the patient was normal. Breast examination and gynecological examination were also normal. Clinically, at that stage, differential diagnoses of metastatic carcinoma, astrocytoma, and adult-onset retinoblastoma were considered by treating ophthalmologist and investigations were planned.\nBlood examination was within normal limits. This included hemoglobin values, total leucocyte count, differential leucocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Peripheral blood smear was normal. The kidney function tests, liver functions tests, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum calcium, and serum phosphorus were normal. Urine examination was also normal. Electrocardiogram was also normal.\nNoncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan off the orbit and Para Nasal Sinuses (PNS) revealed marked left proptosis with markedly expanded left ocular globe by a hyperdense mass, few cystic components with extension into left anterior cranial fossa, left anterior ethmoid, left frontal sinus, left frontal fossa soft tissues with destruction of left orbital walls, and great wing of sphenoid bone []. A precise diagnosis was not possible based upon CT findings. The radiologist considered provisional diagnosis of primary intraocular tumor, metastatic carcinoma, malignant melanoma, or lymphoma and advised further investigations. Chest CT and abdomen ultrasonography were carried out and found to be normal. The patient was referred to us for fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) at this stage.\nFNAC was done using a 22-gauze needle. Smears were prepared, air dried, and stained with Giemsa stain and Periodic Acid Schiff's stain (PAS stain). The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained smears showed small, round cells in cluster and rosettes formation, suggestive of retinoblastoma []. PAS positive granules in the cytoplasm of tumor cells were seen in PAS-stained smears, consistent with the diagnosis of retinoblastoma [].","{

"The patient was a 60-year-old man who referred to our emergency department due to worsening dyspnea and hemoptysis since 2-3 days prior to admission. He reported to have dyspnea and hoarseness during the previous year. He had undergone a direct laryngoscopy which had revealed left vocal cord palsy and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan which had shown a mediastinal mass and with possibility of a malignancy process a direct needle biopsy was done which demonstrated inflammatory cells in the background of blood. His past medical history only included a mild stroke 6 years before without any sequel.\nAt the emergency department he had pulse rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18/min and blood pressure of 135/80 mm Hg. He had a continuous murmur in left sternal and pulmonic area and decreased breathing sound in left hemithorax.\nA chest x-ray was obtained which showed a large density in mediastinum and left sided pleural effusion. In echocardiography he had normal left ventricle but dilated right sided chambers with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis. Trans-esophageal echocardiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of distal aortic arch with clot formation and compression of the main and left pulmonary artery. As a result a chest CT scan with contrast and angiographic construction was done which confirmed the previous finding of a 45 mm × 37 mm pseudoaneurysm in lateral side of aortic arch distal to left subclavian origin with associated 9.5 cm × 10 cm hematoma in mediastinum ( and ). At this stage and upon further investigation he remembered to have fallen down from a few stairs 10 years ago which did not result in any injuries and accordingly he did not seek medical advice.\nThe patient initially refused operation but a few days later developed severe chest pain and so finally agreed to a surgical plan.\nThe patient had a preoperative selective coronary angiography via right radial artery which was normal. He underwent left thoracotomy via femorofemoral bypass. A large pseudoaneurysm of distal aortic arch was detected (). Large hematoma was evacuated from the mediastinum and the aortic wall was repaired with a patch.\nHis hospital course in intensive care unit (ICU) was uneventful and was discharged after 1 week.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Right groin bulge present for 6 weeks', 'Sharp pain initially, now asymptomatic'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgery': 'Right inguinal hernia repair in 1977 without mesh implantation'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Computed tomography scan', 'Finding': 'Right inguinal hernia with appendix present within the sac'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Right inguinal hernia', 'Type': 'Hernia', 'Location': 'Groin'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Hernia repair with appendectomy', 'Details': 'Classic oblique incision, appendectomy performed due to densely adhered omentum preventing reduction of the appendix'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Discharged same day, no complications', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No hernia recurrence, patient doing well'}}}"
"A 38 year old Vietnamese man was admitted with a 10 month history of epigastric pain, fatigue, 10 kg weight loss and recent onset jaundice. He had no other significant medical history. Clinical examination demonstrated anaemia and a tender mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 7 × 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass adjacent to the second part of the duodenum, which contained fluid and air and abutted the hepatic flexure of the colon. The working diagnosis was a collection secondary to a colonic perforation and he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He improved with conservative management and was discharged a month later for outpatient colonoscopy. The colonoscopy revealed a lesion in the transverse colon, histology of which showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nHe subsequently returned to the Accident and Emergency Department following an upper gastrointestinal bleed. On his second admission, a repeat CT scan again suggested localised colonic perforation with formation of an abscess adjacent to the duodenum, along with thickening of the ascending colon, predominantly centred around the hepatic flexure. Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic uncertainty a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed which revealed a large perforated tumour at the hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules. A laparotomy was performed via a transverse incision and following mobilisation of the hepatic flexure, a colonic tumour was found to have invaded the gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity anterior to the second part of the duodenum. At the base of the abscess cavity a large hole was apparent in the second part of the duodenum with malignant tumour invading the duodenum. Given the size of the defect (5 cm × 2 cm) and the presence of tumour it was not possible to resect and form a primary closure of the duodenum. The presence of metastatic spread precluded a curative resection by pancreatoduodenectomy.\nA right hemicolectomy was performed to debulk the tumour and an ileotransverse anastamosis formed. Due to the extent of the disease and associated abscess the anterior wall of the duodenum came away with the colon during this manoeuvre. A retrograde cholecystectomy was carried out to resect the residual tumour invading the gall bladder. The ampulla was identified with the aid of a transcystic catheter. An 82 mm expandable covered duodenal stent with a diameter of 18 mm (Hanarostent, duodenal/pyloric, M.I. Tech Co. Ltd, Seoul, N. Korea) was manually inserted through the duodenal perforation into the proximal duodenum with the distal end of the stent inserted into D2. A small opening into the side wall of the stent was made prior to the positioning of the stent to accommodate the ampulla and thus facilitate drainage of bile within the stent. A per-operative cholangiogram confirmed free flow of contrast in the duodenum. The residual duodenal wall was closed over the stent and following antrectomy a gastrojejunostomy was formed to bypass the duodenum (Bilroth II reconstruction).\nThe patient was discharged 7 weeks later following a prolonged, but otherwise uncomplicated recovery. He subsequently underwent a palliative course of chemotherapy survived for a further 18 months without gastrointestinal symptoms, before succumbing to his disease.","{

"An African American male in his 50s presented with increased shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and orthopnea. He has a past medical history of coronary artery disease with multiple myocardial infarctions and two coronary stents placed in 2003 and two additional coronary stents placed two months prior to his admission. He had a history of systolic heart failure with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 20%. In the emergency department atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noted with a heart rate of 140. A diltiazem infusion was started and he was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Repeat echocardiogram several days later showed progressive worsening of his ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 18%. He was started on inotropic support and underwent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to assist with hemodynamic stability. Approximately 24 hours later the patient had an episode of melena associated with a drop in his hemoglobin from 10.1 to 7.7. He was started on proton pump inhibitor infusion. He underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed erythema and erosions in the gastric fundus compatible with gastritis as well as grade 1 reflux esophagitis but no evidence of active bleeding. A Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was found to be negative. A colonoscopy was performed after hemodynamic stabilization for further evaluation of melena and pretransplant screen. This was positive for abnormal vascularity, congestion, nodularity, erosions, erythema, and ulceration in the cecum and ascending colon suggestive of ischemic colitis which was later confirmed by biopsy (). Given the unusual involvement of nonwatershed areas such as the cecum and ascending colon, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to evaluate the celiac and mesenteric vasculature. There was no significant narrowing of either vessel noted on the CT; however the inferior metallic marker of the IABP was found to be inferior to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (). Findings were consistent with ischemic colitis of the cecum and ascending colon as visualized on colonoscopy from occlusion caused by the IABP. The IABP was repositioned and the patient's melena resolved.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Left breast cancer', 'Large and drooping breasts'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'History of subarachnoid hemorrhage'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Preoperative computed tomography scan', 'Finding': 'Shunt tube pierced the intervertebral lumbar and traveled through the subcutaneous layer of the left trunk'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Breast cancer', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Left breast'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Nipple areola sparing mastectomy and immediate DIEP flap reconstruction', 'Details': 'Flap elevation with precautions for shunt tube, shunt temporarily withdrawn and reinserted, smooth recovery without complications'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Smooth recovery, no signs of increased intracranial pressure or abdominal wall complications', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'One year', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Reconstructed left breast showed good shape and symmetry'}}}"
"A 30-year-old woman was admitted to our institution in June 2002 for the treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk. A giant ICA aneurysm had been found during a previous evaluation of abducens nerve palsy on her right side in November 2001 (). At that time, a tortuous basilar artery had been found, but without any aneurysmal dilatation (). She had undergone endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital (). However, she developed severe headache seven months after the treatment. At the time of admission, she complained of progressive dyspnea, as well as dull headache in the occipital area. Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities. On MR imaging, a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery was found to be compressing the brain stem (). Cerebral angiography showed a fusiform giant aneurysm, with an irregular contour, involving the basilar trunk (). The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm. In addition, another de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA.\nTo relieve the brain stem compression, we decided to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm in spite of the risk associated with this intervention. In advance of performing endovascular embolization of the aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft. This is because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since the patient had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA. The bypass supplied the right middle cerebral artery territory (), and an adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA). During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned and referred for pathologic examination, in an attempt to determine the etiology of the rapid sequential development of the giant fusiform aneurysm.\nFollow-up angiography, performed three days after the bypass surgery, revealed a patent bypass graft. After a test balloon occlusion at the level of the proximal basilar artery, which ensured adequate perfusion to the upper parts of the brain stem and cerebellum through the left PCoA (), coil embolization of the basilar trunk aneurysm was done. Fourteen detachable platinum coils with a total length of 155 cm were deployed in the aneurysm. Upon completion of the embolization procedure, the blood flow to the posterior circulation through the PCoA was maintained well, with near-complete occlusion of the aneurysm (). Postprocedural heparinization was not done. The patient was managed in the neurosurgical intensive care unit and recovered without further neurologic deficit. However, six hours after the end of the embolization procedure, the patient developed dyspnea, dysarthria, and quadriparesis. Intubation and ventilator care was undertaken, and heparinization was started. Enlargement of the aneurysm due to thrombus was revealed by MR imaging, and angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the aneurysm. The patient became stable after two days and, one month after the intervention, independent daily activity became possible and she was discharged from hospital. Pathologic examination of the vessel specimen showed intraluminal projections of fibrous tissue with smooth muscle and capillary proliferation, but failed to reach a definite etiologic diagnosis.\nFollow-up angiography performed three months and one year post-treatment, respectively, revealed complete and stable occlusion of the basilar trunk aneurysm and good perfusion to the entire brain. MR imaging showed marked shrinkage of the aneurysm of the basilar trunk, with no evidence of brain stem compression (). In contrast, the size of the carotid fusiform aneurysm showed no significant change. The patient is currently leading a normal life as a housewife.","{

"A 51-year-old hypertensive Pakistani male patient was admitted in the cardiac intensive care unit in King Fahd University Hospital on 30 July 2017 complaining of chest and back pain for two weeks prior to the presentation; he took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but were not effective. Physical examination was done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed intraoperatively (). Stent graft with a size of 34 mm × 15 cm was used and deployed into the descending thoracic aorta; the intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated. A postdeployment angiogram revealed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries.\nThe patient was postoperatively moving all his limbs, and the peripheral pulses were intact. He got discharged one day after the surgery and was doing well afterward. We evaluated patient's prognosis by following up for 3 to 6 months for a chest X-ray, CTA, and CT aorta 3D reconstruction (Figures and ) which confirmed no endovascular leak as well as no ischemic or stroke signs in the clinical follow-up; we assessed the patency of the subclavian arteries by examining the bilateral upper arms' blood supply in addition to radial arteries by evaluating the pulses with no evidence of morbidity.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of 40% acute flame burns to the neck, chest, anterior abdominal wall, and upper limbs', 'History of multiple abdominal surgeries due to tuberculosis 10 years back', 'Exploratory laparotomy leading to a burst abdomen and temporary colostomy', 'Open mesh repair for ventral hernia leading to infection and mesh removal', 'Second-degree deep dermal burns on skin over ventral hernia requiring grafting', 'Seeking ventral hernia repair after burn wound rehabilitation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Multiple abdominal surgeries due to tuberculosis, burst abdomen, ventral hernia, mesh removal'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Physical Examination', 'Finding': 'Type 2 abdominal wall defect'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Ventral Hernia', 'Type': 'Post-surgical complication', 'Location': 'Abdominal wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'TFL graft from left thigh for closing rectus defect, and islanded TFL myocutaneous flap from right thigh for abdominal defect', 'Details': 'Fascia lata graft and TFL islanded flap used for repair'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No herniation of abdominal contents observed'}}}"
"An 18-year-old male patient (height 140 cm, weight 20 kg) was referred to our hospital for dental treatment under general anesthesia with a chief complaint of an inability to open his mouth wide for dental treatment. The patient was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) at one year of age through muscle biopsy. While he has clear consciousness, he has never walked, as he was unable to move his arms or legs. Since the age of 8, when he suffered aspiration pneumonia, he been completely bedridden and has been using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. The patient usually has his neck turned to the left because he has difficulty breathing and sometimes experiences signs of dyspnea when he turns his neck to the right. He underwent two rounds of general anesthesia for scoliosis surgery in 2008 and 2010, and had a history of tracheostomy for dyspnea that occurred in the intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing general anesthesia for the second time. In a limited manner, the patient was able to voluntarily open his mouth and was able to eat regular food. The patient has been complaining of pain in his TMJ and temporal area during mouth opening for 10 years, which hindered him from receiving treatment for long-term molar pain.\nTherefore, he was referred to undergo general anesthesia for treatment of the molar area. However, we decided to defer general anesthesia due to a high risk of respiratory complications based on his medical history and physical examination, and instead performed local anesthesia of his TMJ area. We determined that the patient had severe pain in the bilateral temporal and TMJ area due to hyperextension of the mouth closing muscle while opening his mouth, and perform local anesthesia to alleviate tension in the TMJ and mouth closing muscle area during dental treatment. At the dental clinic, 1 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine was injected on each side of the TMJ and temporalis fascia before performing oral and maxillofacial surgery (). In approximately 10 minutes, the patient reported feeling no pain while opening his mouth, and oral examination and the required dental treatments were performed while monitoring his oxygen saturation levels. During the examination, his #36, #45, and #46 teeth were identified as severely carious with exposed pulp in addition to a severely carious #26 tooth, moderately carious #13, #37, and #42 teeth, and mildly carious #43 tooth. Hence, we extracted #36 and #46, and performed restorative treatment and root canal for #37 and #45, respectively. The patient maintained a limited degree of mouth opening ability (20 mm), and remaining treatments were conducted in subsequent visits without additional local anesthesia of the mouth closing muscle and TMJ.","{

"A 12-year-old female child presented to us initially when she was 5 years old with an episode of generalized convulsion, loss of consciousness and left sided hemiplegia. A non-contrast CT scan done at this time showed a right posterior frontal hematoma. CT angiography did not show any evidence of a vascular malformation. Digital substraction angiography did not show any arteriovenous malformation, though an early draining vein was visualized []. The patient was managed conservatively. The patient presented 1 year after the episode. She had improved in power in her left sided limbs which was now Grade 3-4/5. She was able to walk on her own with little support. A MRI was performed that showed resolution of the hematoma and the presence of a gliotic cavity. A contrast image showed the normal vessels in the region, and there was no evidence of any flow voids in the region of the cavity. MR angiogram performed at the same time also did not show any evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or nidus []. The patient was again observed and asked to follow-up. The patient presented after 4 years, at the age of 9 years, with complaints of intermittent episodes of seizures. A MRI was again repeated which showed the gliotic cavity on T1 weighted scan. On T2 weighted image, some abnormal vessels were seen in the region of the gliotic cavity. MR angiography showed the presence of an arteriovenous malformation fed by the branches of the middle cerebral artery []. A four vessel angiogram was performed which showed an arteriovenous malformation fed by multiple anterior branches of the middle cerebral artery and drained via multiple veins in the superior sagittal sinus. The patient was advised surgery at this time, but since she only had intermittent episodes of seizures the parents were not willing for surgery. One year after this the patient again presented with complaints of intractable seizures. Digital substraction angiography showed the arteriovenous malformation, similar in size and configuration as was seen earlier []. The patient was now operated. The arteriovenous malformation was resected with routine surgical steps and considerations. The arteriovenous malformation was of significantly high-flow, but could be safely dissected and resected. Post-operatively the patient did well and she did not have any added neurological deficit. Post-operative angiogram showed excision of the arteriovenous malformation. At a follow-up after 1 year of surgery, she was well and was free from convulsions. Her hemiparesis persisted.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['37-year-old woman with ASD caring for mother with end-stage breast cancer', 'Daughter with ASD struggling with caregiving responsibilities and communication'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Diagnosis': 'ASD'}}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'ASD', 'Type': 'Developmental disorder', 'Location': 'Not applicable'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Consultation and social skill training', 'Details': 'Provided guidance on managing communication and caregiving responsibilities'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Five months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Gradually obtained life skills in communication and scheduling'}}}"
"A 34 year old Persian woman, gravida 1, para 0, presented at 22 weeks of pregnancy with a two week history of left hip pain with no apparent precipitating event. Her past medical history included mild Multiple Sclerosis from which she was asymptomatic. She did not smoke or drink alcohol, had no history of corticosteroid, anticonvulsant or anticoagulant use and was not on any other medication. Clinical examination was unremarkable and no investigations were deemed appropriate. The working diagnosis at this stage was non-specific hip pain related to pregnancy and supportive measures were instituted.\nOver the following 12 weeks her hip pain worsened, and she started to experience pain in the contra lateral hip. Again there was no history of a traumatic event. Because of her pregnancy imaging of her hips was avoided. By 36 weeks of pregnancy she was unable to weight bear and became wheelchair bound. Pain in her hips and limitation of motion meant that a normal vaginal delivery was impossible; hence she underwent a caesarean delivery of a healthy baby at full term.\nShe was brought to the attention of the orthopaedic team when plain radiographs (see figure ) following delivery revealed a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the left and a valgus impacted right intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the right. The radiographs also revealed considerable osteopaenia. MRI (see figure ) revealed these fractures, with reduced signal on T1 and increased signal on T2 in the femoral necks in keeping with TOP.\nShe underwent closed reduction and internal fixation of the left hip. The right hip was internally fixed in situ. Two hole 135 degree dynamic hip screws were used in order to provide sufficient stability to allow immediate mobilisation despite bilateral fractures. Difficulty was encountered in ensuring that the threads of the dynamic hip screw had crossed the fracture site in the left hip as the level of the fracture was high in the femoral neck, consequently the tip of the implant had to be implanted close to the subchondral plate (see figure ).\nThe post-operative course was uncomplicated and the hip pain significantly improved immediately. Full weight bearing on the right, and partial weight bearing on the left was initiated on the first postoperative day, and maintained for the first 12 weeks. Check radiographs at 3 months showed no loss of fixation and the fractures appeared to be uniting in an adequate position. At six months she was pain free with no evidence of avascular necrosis or implant failure.","{

"A 60-year-old female who was previously healthy with no risk factors for stroke presented with sudden onset left-sided weakness and dysphasia. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 20. Brain computer tomography did not reveal any established infarct, however a computer tomography cranial angiogram showed evidence of thrombus in the proximal right middle cerebral artery (). She was treated with thrombolysis and endovascular mechanical clot removal ( and ()) with a successful outcome of recovering to a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 2 within 24 hours.\nAs a part of stroke work-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Interestingly magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple infarcts with haemorrhages in the right middle cerebral artery territory and bilateral cerebellar hemisphere raising a possibility of an embolic source (). While reviewing the history, it became obvious that the patient had not been well for the previous four weeks prior to admission. She had a low grade pyrexia and mildly raised inflammatory markers with associated anaemia and thrombocytopenia. All the above symptoms and image findings raised the possibility of infective endocarditis.\nAn urgent echocardiogram established a mobile mass in the anterior mitral valve leaflet indicative of a vegetation which was further proven on transoesophageal echocardiography. It was a large mobile mass measuring about 11 × 4 mm and prolapsing in to the left ventricular outflow tract with mild aortic regurgitation (). She was then treated for infective endocarditis with intravenous antibiotics. Despite therapy she continued to have an intermittent fever with persistent raised inflammatory markers. However serial blood cultures and serology remained sterile. Further studies including virology, vasculitic screen (together with thrombophilia screen) and serology for atypical organisms were negative.\nHence a computer tomography of thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed to identify an infective focus. Interestingly an underlying large pelvic mass suggestive of a right-sided ovarian tumour (9 × 9 cm) was found without any evidence of metastasis (). Imaging also revealed pulmonary, splenic and renal embolic events with evidence of infarcts. Multi systemic embolisation with poor clinical response to antibiotics raised a suspicion of non bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Therefore low molecular weight heparin was commenced. She underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. A high grade ovarian clear cell carcinoma was confirmed on histology.\nSerial repeat transthoracic and transoesophgeal echocardiography was performed to assess the size of the vegetation as a response to anticoagulation and a promising result was demonstrated ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Dull gnawing pain and growth in the mouth for 5 years', 'Difficulty in eating and swallowing'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Road traffic accident resulting in injuries to upper front teeth, lower lip, and left side of the face'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Computed tomography angiogram', 'Finding': 'Soft-tissue shadow with calcifications, involving destruction of maxilla in the premolar region'}, {'Test': 'Histopathological examination', 'Finding': 'Fibrous, connective tissue with numerous plump fibroblasts, areas of ossification, chronic inflammatory cells, and blood vessels'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Peripheral ossifying fibroma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Left maxillary alveolus and palate'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Weber Fergusson with lateral limb modification', 'Details': 'Excision of the lesion from the maxilla, postoperative packing with iodoform gauze, construction of obturator'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No evidence of recurrence'}}}"
"A 40-year-old man presented with fresh hemorrhagic stool. Colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed, but the bleeding site was not clear in the visible range of the stomach, duodenum, and colon. On hospital day 2, capsule endoscopy was performed, and bleeding from the small intestine was detected. On hospital day 3, the patient developed shock due to massive bleeding. Hence, emergency transcatheter arterial embolization was performed. He had a history of surgery for anal atresia and small bowel stoma as a neonate, and he required hemodialysis because of chronic renal failure with bilateral kidney malformations. Computed tomography performed before transcatheter arterial embolization showed that the anatomy of the left common iliac artery was normal. However, the right external iliac artery was defective. Blood from the right common iliac artery flowed directly into a traveling vessel: the internal iliac artery. The blood vessel descended at an acute angle to the pelvic floor, and then, it rose and flowed into the femoral artery (Fig. ). We chose to insert the catheter from the left femoral artery and then further selectively advanced the catheter to the superior mesenteric artery, which is the responsible vessel for gastrointestinal bleeding. Regarding the superior mesenteric artery, the branch from the aorta was at the same level as the celiac artery, and the right hepatic artery originated from the superior mesenteric artery. But angiography did not show a clear extravasation from either branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Small intestinal endoscopy was performed on hospital day 8. However, it was impossible to advance the endoscope because the small intestinal adhesion was very strong. Thereafter, there was no massive bleeding. He was discharged home on hospital day 20 after red blood cell transfusion. Later, he was hospitalized again for small intestinal resection. In the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was firmly adhered. First, 30 cm of the adhered small intestine was resected. Then, small intestinal endoscopy was performed through the small bowel stump. There were two diverticula on the oral side, but no obvious bleeding was found. A submucosal cystic lesion was found during small intestinal resection, and it was judged to be a bleeding site due to redness.\nLater, it was confirmed that he met the diagnostic criteria for VATER association because of the deformity of the sacrum, right aplastic kidney, left hypoplastic kidney (Fig. ), and history of anal atresia.","{

"Staged bilateral total hip arthroplasties were performed on a 55-year-old man with a neglected untreated history of DDH, who gradually developed severe bilateral hip joint arthritis. The chief complains included bilateral hips and knee joints pain on walking associated with a progressive limitation in the range of hip motion and walking ability distance day after day. The history of the present problem went back to the age 45 with an incident of the low back pain repeated at the ages 50 and 52; each time relieved by conventional bed rest and other conservative measures. The progressive changes in lumbar spine (L2-L3) including discopathies and stenosis of the spinal canal were also contributed to his limitation of walking ability for last 10 years.\nThe patient was born as the last member of a large size family of a second degree consanguineous traditional marriage, with the maternal age 43, having 3 sisters and 4 brothers without hip disease. In the past medical history, the patient presented a history of the right nasolacrimal stenosis operated at the age of 3 and 8, right inguinal hernia operated for at 1 and 3. A suspected dentine dysplasia characterized by deciduous and permanent teeth with clinically normal appearing crowns, some hypermobility and spontaneous dental abscesses started in childhood and ended with the loss of all teeth at the age of 22 to 27. An unsuccessful closed reduction of the left hip joint at the age of 11 put in spica cast from the tip of the toe up to the chest level was performed and immobilized for 9 months. A history of night bedwetting, up to the age of 11, due to urinary reflux evolving in the left renal regression and hypoplasia, accidentally revealed upon a renal infection and diagnosed by renal angiography at the age of 22. A problem of ingrown toe nail started from the age of adolescence with multiple recurrence after a surgical correction was noticed. Two attacks of the left ear Menier’s disease reported to be experienced at the age of 33 and 44 years, ended with the total hearing loss and a residual continuous tinnitus. The patient and family had a habit of W-sitting from the childhood. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol use. NSAIDS was the only medication he received. He was married having two children, a daughter (16 years old) and a son (15 years old), none of them having hip problems.\nPhysical examination revealed marked limitation of motion with some pelvic obliquity, a positive bilateral Trendelenberg test, mild gluteal asymmetry, apparent limb length discrepancy, severe crepitation during hip flexion, and painful hip in long time standing and walking.\nThe pelvic X-ray showed false acetabulum, broken Shenton’s line which was worse on the left side, severe arthritis changes such as diminished joint space, ossified neolimbi on both sides as shown in (arrows), large osteophytes and bony spurs, loss of cartilage, massive sclerotic changes on both sides, dislocation on the left and subluxation on the right side. Increased anteversion of the femoral neck of the left side and lateral views are shown in lateral views of both hips ( and ).\nUneventful cementless total hip arthroplasties were performed on both hips. The acetabular cups were placed close to anatomic true acetabulum. Post-op anteroposterior view of the pelvis shows implantation of the femoral and acetabular components (Titanium cementless press fit). The movement occurs between a chrom-cobalt head on a highly cross linked polyethene liner ().\nThe patient got ambulated walking with crutches the day after the surgery and was able to walk without crutches six weeks after the second operation. During the first six week post-op, conventional physical therapy was instructed. No leg length discrepancy was noticed seven days after the second THR operation and remained as such thereafter (). This is demonstrated by the symmetrically located stem part of the prostheses in relation to the pubic ramus verified by equally broken Shentons’ lines shown in the post-op pelvic radiograph ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Throbbing pain in relation to upper left canine tooth', 'Occasional pain since 1 year following orthognathic surgery on upper maxilla'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Root injury in middle third of the root'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiograph', 'Finding': 'Root injury in middle third of the root'}, {'Test': 'Periodontal probing', 'Finding': 'Periodontal pocket of 9mm probing depth'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Acute periodontal abscess with tooth root resorption', 'Type': 'Periodontal', 'Location': 'Periapex of upper left canine tooth'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Root canal treatment and Modified Widman flap surgery', 'Details': 'Root canal treatment followed by Modified Widman flap surgery with Glass ionomer cement restoration'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Complete cessation of aggressive root resorption'}}}"
"The patient is a male in his 60s with a past medical history significant for pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was referred to neurology clinic for progressive, bilateral, lower extremity numbness which he noted first in his feet. The patient indicated the pain and tingling in his feet worsened with prolonged standing and walking. He also endorsed lower back pain on follow-up visits. MRI of the thoracic cord demonstrated a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. The initial workup was unrevealing for an etiology and initial suspicions were that his condition was due to neurosarcoidosis. A lumbar puncture was performed and negative. Upon further review of the spinal imaging it was thought that there may be dilatation of the spinal epidural venous plexus, which would potentially indicate a dural arteriovenous fistula. The patient was then taken for a catheter angiogram for further evaluation.\nDuring angiography, the left and right subclavian arteries were imaged to evaluate for spinal cord blood flow. An injection within the aorta was required to establish a road map for the left vertebral artery and the left vertebral artery origin from the aortic arch was found. An injection of the aortic arch origin of the vertebral artery revealed complete filling of all segments of the left vertebral artery. Retrograde filling of the left subclavian artery was seen indicating a potential dual origin from the left subclavian artery. A catheter was placed within the left subclavian and a second origin of the left vertebral artery was appreciated to originate and merge with the aortic V1 segment at the level of the C5 vertebrae (Figure ). Equal filling was seen from both the aortic and subclavian origin. No aneurysms or dissections were appreciated in either origin or at the confluence. When the right T7 spinal artery was injected, a dAVF was observed. The fistula originated from a distal branch of the spinal artery and combined with an anterior spinal vein with abnormal filling appreciated. The rest of the spinal arteries were interrogated and noted to be grossly normal without aneurysms, fistulas, or other vascular abnormalities.\nPost-procedure and follow-up\nThe patient underwent embolization of the right T7 spinal artery was performed with obliteration of the fistula (Figure ). The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was discharged home.","{

"A 54-year-old female, who was found to have incidental giant left ICA aneurysm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, during the workup for headaches (). There was no history of thunderclap headache or any associated visual or neurologic symptoms to suggest aneurysm rupture. Initial angiogram for evaluation of aneurysm, demonstrated a large left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm, measuring around 26×19 mm with a wide neck of 14 mm (). There was a patent anterior communicating artery with brisk cross filling of the left cerebral vasculature from the contralateral right side as well as patent left PCOM artery. Considering the complex anatomy, size of aneurysm and presence of good collaterals with patent anterior and PCOM artery, a plan was made in another hospital to treat the aneurysm with parent vessel occlusion rather than flow diverter stent. Subsequently, the aneurysm was treated in October 2016. Initially, a balloon occlusion test of the left ICA was performed which was negative for any neurological change during 20 minutes of balloon occlusion with blood pressure challenge as well. Subsequently, occlusion of the left ICA proximal to the aneurysm was performed using multiple coils (, ). There was no antegrade flow into the left ICA after occlusion with a patent flow into the left cerebral hemisphere through a patent anterior and PCOM arteries (, ). Angiogram of the left vertebral artery after occlusion of left ICA showed retrograde filling of the left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm (, ). This was considered to occlude overtime considering the competing antegrade intracranial flow. Patient remained asymptomatic after the treatment. Follow up angiogram after 6 months and 2 years demonstrated no antegrade flow in the left ICA, however there was persistent filling of the left ICA aneurysm in a retrograde fashion through the PCOM artery (). The aneurysm was followed up for another year and showed no evidence of occlusion with similar retrograde filling through the PCOM artery with no much change in its size. At this stage, considering the persistent filling of aneurysm, treatment was contemplated and the patient was transferred to our institution. She was successfully treated with a flow diverter stent across the PCOM artery into the distal left ICA. Patient recovered well, with no obvious neurological deficit or post-operative complications. Follow up angiogram after six months of flow diverter stent demonstrated patent flow in the PCOM artery with complete occlusion of the aneurysm with no residual filling (). presents an illustration of the final treatment construct.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Grade IIIb compound fracture tibia with a 20cm by 8 cms wound over the anteromedial side of lower third of tibia', 'Periosteum exposed in lower third of tibia', 'Badly contaminated wound'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Road traffic accident resulting in crushed left leg under a truck tyre'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Distal third tibia fracture with segmental piece of tibia and comminution'}, {'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Short oblique fibula fracture at same level as tibia'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Grade IIIb compound fracture tibia with contaminated wound', 'Type': 'Orthopedic injury', 'Location': 'Lower third of tibia'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Debridement, external fixator, wound dressing, antibiotic therapy, flap surgery, bone grafting', 'Details': 'Multiple debridements performed, external fixator used, cross leg flap surgery, bone grafting with cancellous graft from iliac crest'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Continuous wound care and monitoring, immobilization in long knee brace', 'DischargeStatus': 'Full weight bearing achieved at 8 months post trauma'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '5 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Walking full weight bearing, restricted ankle movement but able to carry out all activities'}}}"
"A 35-year-old white female who was an elite endurance athlete training for triathlons had a 3-year history of chronic left hip and groin pain which was subsequently investigated by MRI study.

She had a history of prolonged flights; however, none were taken immediately prior to her investigation. She was on oral contraceptives, which were subsequently discontinued, with no additional medications. She was a lifetime nonsmoker and had no symptoms to suggest concurrent pulmonary embolism. She had a prior hand surgery with no perioperative complications. Her examination was normal with no evidence of leg swelling or asymmetry and no evidence of postthrombotic syndrome.\nShe was started on anticoagulation and 3 weeks later had an ultrasound of her left lower limb that showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis, which included the common femoral and external iliac veins. It was concluded that it was difficult to exclude a clot proximal to the iliac vein thus, she was continued on warfarin for 6 months. Following her anticoagulation, she underwent a MR angiogram and venogram. There was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis; however, there was significant narrowing of the upper aspect of the left common iliac vein just as it passed under the right common iliac artery prior to its joining with the right iliac vein. There was no associated dilation of the peripheral left iliac veins, and remaining veins were unremarkable for compression or malformation. These findings were highly suggestive of iliac vein compression. A thrombophilia screen was done following anticoagulation therapy, which showed the patient was heterozygous for Factor V Leiden mutation.\nSoon afterward, the patient had a pelvic venogram illustrating stenosis of the left common iliac vein consistent with external compression with some collateral veins. Pressure measurements were done across the stenosis with a mean pressure gradient of 9 mm Hg. A 14 mm × 60 mm Nitinol self-expanding stent was deployed across the stenosis and dilated with a 12 mm balloon (). Good restoration was confirmed on angiography with a mean pressure gradient of 2 mm Hg. She was given 300 mg of Plavix at the time of the procedure and continued Plavix 75 mg for a total of two months. She did well after treatment and continues to take part in her regular training with no further complications.","{

"A 19-year-old male had a history of road traffic accident 18 months back with severe head injury and pelvic fracture. He remained in the referring hospital for three months. After discharge he remained reasonably well except for occasional episodes of anterior chest pain and dyspnea on moderate exertion.\nRecently he was admitted again through the emergency department with complain of severe chest pain along with shortness of breath. CT chest with intravenous contrast showed large aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta distal to the origin of left subclavian artery causing compression on the origin of the left main bronchus, and on the right and left pulmonary arteries with no evidence of dissecting or contrast leak; however, the patient referred to the vascular surgical unit in our institute for further management.\nAfter admission he complained of mild shortness of breath. His vital signs and his routine blood investigation were within normal limits. His chest radiograph showed normal bilateral lung fields.\nHe underwent endoluminal thoracic aortic stenting under general anesthesia. Postoperatively the patient started to complain of severe dyspnea and was desaturating. His immediate post-procedure routine chest X-ray revealed complete collapse of the left lung []. An urgent CT chest with intravenous contrast showed endovascular stent in place, but the aneurysmal sac was completely occluding the left main bronchus with complete collapse of the left lung but with adequate perfusion. The aneurysmal sac also had a mass compression on the adjacent right main pulmonary artery, which was compressed and stretched maximum at its proximal portion [].\nPatient was stable hemodynamically and with relatively acceptable arterial blood gases.\nHe was monitored closely for possible emergency intervention with an endobronchial stent.\nAlthough placement of an endobronchial stent in the left main bronchus can open the collapsed left lung, at the same time it may increase the pressure and can occlude the compressed right pulmonary artery supplying the only aerated right lung which could cause major morbidity, so, a conservative plan was adopted.\nAfter 18 hours the apex of the left lung started to open up radiologically which showed up on the chest X-ray. Patient’s arterial blood gas was improved gradually with the improvement of the expansion of the left lung over the next few days. He was discharged on the 15th post-op day with complete expansion of the left lung []. He remained asymptomatic over the next fifteen months on his regular outpatient follow-up.","{

"An 86-year old woman presented at the emergency department suffering from severe acute upper abdominal pain. Her past medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and twenty years before she had an omphalocele repair. The patient was in a close clinical and radiological follow up for monitoring a pancreatic serous cystadenoma diagnosed incidentally with a computed tomography (CT) scan 10 years earlier. The lesion was extensively studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), fine needle aspiration (FNA), serology and blood test screening. At that time she was addressed for a routine year follow up scan which she attended regularly for six years. Patient did not attend her follow up time table for the last four years. Upon admission to the emergency department, chest and abdominal x-rays were performed and turned out inconclusive. Routine laboratory studies revealed marked leukocytosis, severe anemia, and blood glucose levels exceeding 500 mg/dl. Due to inconclusive diagnosis, an intravenous contrast CT scan was ordered and revealed a large amount of free peritoneal air and free fluid. (Figure , ) Moreover, a left upper quadrant 17 cm large mass originating from the stomach was revealed along with secondary liver lesions. An urgent laparotomy showed a prepyloric ulcer perforation and a large inoperable mass arising from the pancreatic body and largely invading the posterior wall of the stomach occupying the upper abdomen with multiple hepatic secondary lesions. A liver biopsy was taken, the stomach perforation was sutured closed and a washout was performed. The histopathologic findings from the biopsy material were consisted of small and medium size cystic lesions surrounded and divided by hyalloid collagenous matrix. The cysts were lined by cuboidal epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm and round nuclei without atypical or mitotic activity as demonstrated by pathology. The glycogen content was documented by PAS positive reaction. These findings were consistent with serous microcystic adenoma of the pancreas and the malignant nature of the tumor was confirmed by the presence of the extensive invasive large inoperable pancreatic mass with hepatic metastasis. The patient after a brief period in intensive care unit for respiratory problems recovered from surgery in 10 days but died a month later because of other, unrelated, serious medical problems.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chief complaint of right groin bulge present for 6 weeks', 'Initial sharp pain followed by asymptomatic period'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousHerniaRepair': 'Previous right inguinal hernia repair in 1977 without mesh implantation'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Right inguinal hernia with appendix present within the sac'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Right inguinal hernia', 'Type': 'Hernia', 'Location': 'Groin'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical repair with appendectomy', 'Details': 'Incision made in right groin, appendix and densely adhered omentum reduced back into abdominal cavity.

A 28-year-old male presented with a painless swelling in the volar aspect of right mid forearm of 10 years duration with complaints of increase in size of the swelling associated with pain for the past two years. He complained of pain and paresthesia in the median nerve distribution of the right hand. The swelling measured 6 cms in length and 5 cms in width. The swelling was mobile on the transverse axis and not on the longitudinal axis. There was no motor weakness. There was normal protective sensation present in the hand. Percussion over the nerve produced positive Tinel’s sign. There was no family history of neurofibromatosis and no associated clinical features. The ultrasound showed that the mass was subcutaneous although limited and homogeneous measuring 6 cm in diameter. The patient refused to undergo MRI examination due to financial constraints. A surgical workup and a preoperative anaesthetist assessment were obtained. With a clinical diagnosis of median nerve tumor the patient was planned for excision of the tumor. The patient was explained regarding the neurological deficit following surgery and that she may need a sural nerve graft. The patient was taken up for surgery in supraclavicular block with bupivacaine and Xylocaine under tourniquet control.\nAdequate exposure of the nerve was done both proximal and distal to the tumour (). On exploration the tumour was found to be arising from the median nerve in the right mid forearm. It was a well encapsulated greyish tumour () placed in an eccentric position to the axis of the nerve (). The vascular pedicle in the proximal part of the tumour is identified first and the remaining tumour was gently resected using microsurgical techniques. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination. Histopathological examination of the masses revealed typical features of schwannoma with presence of spindle cells forming Verocay bodies and clearly identified Antony A and B areas (). At two months follow-up the patient was symptom free with mild paresthesia in his index and middle fingers. There was no motor deficit or pain and no recurrence of the lumps ().,"{

"A 29 years old male patient was taken to our emergency department within one hour of following motor vehicle accident. He complained of severe chest and back pain. On examination he was alert, conscious with pulse rate of 134 per minute, blood pressure of 86/64 mm/Hg, the extremities were cold and clammy. On auscultation, the heart sounds were audible without any adventitious sounds. The breath sounds were diminished in the left lower chest. A chest x-ray was done which revealed multiple rib fracture with mediastinal widening and left pleural effusion. In view of excruciating chest and back pain with features of hemorrhagic shock, a suspicion of aortic injury was made and hence an urgent emergency department CT scan was done after that the patient was shifted quickly to the emergency operation theater without waiting for the reports and the CT film. While shifting to the operation theater the film was obtained on the operation theater console which revealed a contained ruptured aortic rupture immediately below the level of isthmus (). An intervention cardiologist opinion was sought for endovascular stenting but in view of lacerated aorta involving more than 50% of its circumference at the site of injury, it was not possible and hence an urgent open surgical technique was advised. The patient was taken to operation theatre and intubated with single lung tube. He was positioned in right lateral position. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was done and the chest cavity was entered through the fifth intercostal space. A huge contained hematoma was noted. The patient was heparinized a plan to conduct surgery on left heart bypass on normothermia was decided. One of the 16Fr aortic cannula was inserted to the left superior pulmonary vein as outflow circuit and another 18Fr aortic cannula was inserted to the descending thoracic aorta just above the level of diaphragm as inflow circuit and the circuit was connected to the heart and lung machine. The bypass was initiated at flow rate of 1500 mL/min. A cross clamp was applied 2 cm below the origin of left subclavian artery and another aortic cross clamp was applied on the descending thoracic aorta just proximal to the thoracic aortic cannulation. Clots and debris were removed gently and it was observed that more than half of the circumference of the aortic lumen was torn approximately 5cm distal to the left subclavian artery (). The margins were trimmed and a 26 mm synthetic polyester Dacron tube interposition graft was sewn to both the ends using No 5-0 polypropylene suture, de-airing was performed by releasing the distal clamp first. The patient was weaned off gradually from the left heart bypass and the rest of the procedures were conducted uneventfully. The patient responded well and is on regular follow up for the last two years and the follow up CT scan of the repair is satisfactory ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change', 'Grade IV motor power on both legs', 'Hypoesthesia below the level of the xiphoid process'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastMedication': 'Anti-arrhythmic medications for a year'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'No mass lesions in solid organs'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Multiple myeloma', 'Type': 'Spinal metastasis', 'Location': 'T8 level'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Spinal decompression and stabilization', 'Details': 'Total laminectomy of T8, pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10, partial removal of tumors at ventral side of dura sac, resection of T8 roots'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Paraplegic', 'DischargeStatus': 'Remained paraplegic without improvements'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Remained paraplegic without any neurologic improvements'}}}"

"A 44-year-old Caucasian female referred to the ER with acute abdominal pain. Past medical history revealed no family history of colon cancer and no history of smoke. At the admission, physical examination revealed pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no signs of bowel obstruction, mimicking an acute appendicitis. Laboratory investigation has not shown important pathological signs. Ultrasonography examination of the abdomen showed a contracted gallbladder with normal bile ducts, no pathologies affecting the pancreas and neither free fluid, nor signs of acute appendicitis. In consideration of the clinical status of the patient and the persistent acute abdominal pain even with a negative ultrasound, a CT scan was performed to better comprehend the nature of the underling pathology. CT scan was performed four hours after the hospital admission, and demonstrated a thickened cecal wall with a small number of pathological nearby lymph nodes, confirming the absence of peritoneal free fluid. Given the absence of radiological signs of GI perforations and of other surgical and medical emergencies, we decided to perform a colonoscopy to better understand the etiology of the underling pathology. Colonoscopy was performed 24 hours after the hospital admission and after an adequate bowel preparation and revealed a massive, ulcerated, stenotic and necrotic lesion that involved the caecum and the right colon. Biopsies of the lesion were performed and the microscopic examination showed a cell proliferation composed by large, pleomorphic cellular elements with vesicular nuclei, hyperchromatic nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm, mixed with necrotic tissue. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma ().\nFor these reasons, a laparoscopic right colectomy in an elective setting was performed, together with an accurate lymphadenectomy. Surgical exploration of the abdominal cavity confirmed the absence of peritoneal carcinosis and distant metastasis. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed an ulcerated lesion of the right colon with a 6 cm diameter, composed of a whitish and compact tissue, with hard consistency and infiltrative margins that extended to the perivisceral adipose tissue. Microscopic examination discovered a poorly differentiated neoplastic epithelial tumor, rich in mitosis, with large-sized cellular elements characterized by vesicular nuclei, occasional nuclear pseudoinclusions, hyperchromatic nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm and organized in chains and clusters and mixed with necrotic areas. Additionally, an inflammatory component made of lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells with a polytypic expression of Immunoglobulin light chains was present. The neoplastic epithelial tumor showed the following immunohistochemical profile: positive for CK7 (focal), CAM 5.2 (focal), CKAE1/AE3 (focal), Calretinin (focal), Claudin 4, and negative for CK20, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, CDX2, TTF-1, P63, CK5-6, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD79, MUM1, S100, ER, MART-1, EBV; proliferation cell index MIB1 was higher than 50% (). None of the 35 lymph nodes collected and examined showed presence of malignant cells. The final staging of the disease was B2 according to Astler and Coller, Stage III according to Jass and pT3 N0 Mo for the TNM classification.\nThe molecular analysis for the MSI has identified a High level of Microsatellite Instability (MSI-H) and was performed with the study of fragments with 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer - Applied Biosystems.\nThis particular profile, especially the lack of expression of CDX2 and the positivity for Calretinin, oriented the diagnosis towards a MC rather than to a poorly differentiated carcinoma.\nSubsequently, in consideration of different variables, such as the histological characteristics, the poor degree of differentiation, the presence of vascular infiltration, the medullary histological type and the age of the patient, the patient underwent an adjuvant chemotherapy according to the FOLFOX - 4 schedule for 12 cycles (association of 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin).\nAfter 24 months from the index surgery, the patient is disease free and with a good quality of life.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Right groin bulge present for 6 weeks', 'Sharp pain initially, now asymptomatic'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgery': 'Right inguinal hernia repair in 1977 without mesh implantation'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Right inguinal hernia', 'Type': 'Hernia', 'Location': 'Right groin'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Hernia repair', 'Details': 'Appendectomy performed due to chronic adhesions preventing reduction of appendix'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No complications, discharged same day', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No recurrence, patient doing well'}}}"

"A 17-year-old Malay girl was involved in a road traffic accident in which she sustained a closed right femur fracture. She was treated with intramedullary nailing of the right femur. She was well until two years after the initial trauma when she met with another road traffic accident. The patient fell off her motorcycle and was brought to our centre with severe right thigh pain. Clinically, the right thigh was deformed with no obvious open wound. There was no other associated injury and the neurovascular status was intact. A plain radiograph shown 30° varus angulation of the femoral nail in the AP view and 30° anterior angulation in the lateral view with the continuity of the nail intact (). The fracture site was noted to be not united with minimal callus formation. It was decided to remove the nail surgically. The surgery was done under regional (spinal) anaesthesia with the patient being placed in the left lateral decubitus position. A skin incision was made by a lateral approach at the fracture site under image intensifier guidance. The tissue was divided layer by layer until the fracture site and the fibrous tissue around it was cleared up.\nThe initial technique attempted was based on the principle of partially weakening the nail followed by manual straightening. The bent nail was partially resected using a jumbo cutter through the wound, then reduction was attempted using the bone holder forceps placed at the proximal and distal part of the fracture site and the strength was applied to straighten the bent nail. However, the correction failed. We then proceeded with the second technique of fully cutting the nail and then extracting it into two different pieces. The distal locking screw was removed, followed by removal of the proximal locking screw. Manual traction was applied as a distraction at the fracture site to fully visualise the apex of angulation of the bent nail. A Jumbo cutter was introduced up to the visible nail and it was sectioned by multiple bites into two parts as shown in . Continuous saline irrigation was done during the transection of the nail. The proximal part of the nail was extracted with a standard technique using extraction nail system and the distal part was extracted through the fracture site using pliers. A bone graft was done and a locking compression plate was inserted to stabilize the fractured femur. () Post-operative recuperation was uneventful and - the patient was discharged well without any complications.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Admitted due to a cystic tumor in pancreatic body and tail'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal CT scan and EUS', 'Finding': '5x4 cm sized, slightly septated cystic tumor between the body and tail of the pancreas'}, {'Test': 'Pathologic Examination', 'Finding': 'Benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without characteristics of malignant potential'}, {'Test': 'Color Doppler Ultrasound Scan', 'Finding': 'No evidence of splenic infarction and well-preserved blood flow within the spleen'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Benign mucinous cystic neoplasm', 'Type': 'Cystic tumor', 'Location': 'Pancreatic body and tail'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with robot-assisted surgery', 'Details': 'Segmental resection of splenic vessels for spleen preservation'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No complications, returned to oral diet on postoperative second day', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on the fifth day post-operation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '14 days', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No definitive peripancreatic fluid collection detected'}}}"
"A 22 year old male patient had sustained chest injury by a metal splinter under moderate velocity. He presented with an entry wound in the 9th intercostal space, anterior axillary line on the right side. He was hemodynamically stable and had no respiratory symptoms or signs and abdomen was normal. Two coordinates of X-ray chest revealed the presence of foreign body in the (R) hemithorax, we suspected that the foreign body could be in the thoracoabdominal cavity based on the mechanism of injury. CT scan confirmed our suspicion that a sharp foreign body was indeed in the (R) thoracic cavity, not close to major vessels. There was a minimal pneumothorax which was not evident clinically. This sharp foreign body mandated removal. We decided to try minimal access surgery but with full preparations for open thoracotomy in case of failure. He needed one lung ventilation as a prerequisite for thoracoscopy. Hence the procedure was done under general anesthesia and intubated with a double lumen tube. He was placed on the anterolateral right thoracotomy position. Single lung ventilation was instituted. In addition CO2 insufflation was given up to 5mm Hg, for safer initial trocar placement and better visualization of hemithorax. A 10mm camera port was placed in the (R) 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. A 5 mm working port was placed in the same intercostal space. The foreign body was seen on the inferior surface of the lung and removed through the 10 mm port Figures and . The rest of the thoracic cavity and diaphragm were found to be normal. An intercostal tube was placed in the 10 mm port site. He had no adverse event intraoperatively and promptly recovered from anesthesia, with a well expanded lung that was confirmed clinically and with a bedside X ray. However, we still continued to ventilate him electively for 18 hours as our experience with one lung ventilation is limited. He was extubated and ICD removed the same day. He was discharged on the second postoperative day. He is followed up regularly and is doing well.","{

"A 32-year-old man sustained injury to his right leg in a road traffic accident five years ago. He had mangled leg which resulted in a below knee amputation done at a local hospital. The stump had healed with secondary intention owing to insufficient soft tissue cover and infection []. He was fitted with prosthesis and was allowed ambulation. However, the loading area of the stump had repeated breakdown and the stump became extremely sensitive and painful. He was unable to wear the prosthesis and bear weight on the stump. The bone length was maintained at 12 cm below the tibial plateau and soft tissue cover was possible only at the expense of the shortening of the stump. Salvage of the stump was only possible with adequate soft tissue cover. Reconstruction of the stump was planned with anterolateral thigh flap from the opposite side. The scar tissue was excised completely till the bone. About 2 cm tibial end was projecting in the wound []. A 14 × 14cms flap along with vastus lateralis muscle was harvested with the patient in supine position. Subsequently the patient was made to lie prone for recipient vessel dissection in the popliteal fossa. Anastomosis was done end-to-end to popliteal vessels with minimal vessel diameter discrepancy []. The vastus lateralis muscle in the flap covered the bony stump and flap was insetted snugly to the defect without any redundancy. Duration of the operation was six hours. The postoperative period was uneventful, and skin grafted donor site healed satisfactorily. The patient was discharged on 16th post operative day. He was refitted with prosthesis 10 weeks after the surgery. He is a school teacher by profession and he is on the prosthesis for approximately 70 hours per week. He is symptom free at 20 months after the surgery and flap does not show any atrophy or redundancy []. He experienced remarkable improvement and can stand for 5 hours at a stretch without any pain. His pain free walking distance has increased from half a mile preoperatively to two miles post-operatively []. Although no nerve was anstomosed, the patient appreciates pain on deep pressure and can distinguish hot and cold sensation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Full thickness burn wounds over right scapula, right upper limb, and anterior abdominal wall', 'Perforation of the intestine with prolapse of intestinal loops through abdominal wound'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Contact with 11,000 volts high tension electric wire'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Physical Examination', 'Finding': 'Full thickness burn wounds and intestinal prolapse'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Burn wounds', 'Type': 'Full thickness', 'Location': 'Right scapula, right upper limb, and anterior abdominal wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative management followed by surgical intervention', 'Details': 'Debridement of necrotic skin, split skin grafts, repair of enterocutaneous fistula, ventral hernia repair with synthetic mesh and flap cover'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful healing of wounds and resolution of enterocutaneous fistula', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged after 17 days post-surgery with advice to wear an abdominal binder'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No ventral hernia, flat and intact abdominal wall, patient satisfied with results'}}}"
"A 51-year-old hypertensive Pakistani male patient was admitted in the cardiac intensive care unit in King Fahd University Hospital on 30 July 2017 complaining of chest and back pain for two weeks prior to the presentation; he took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but were not effective. Physical examination was done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed intraoperatively (). Stent graft with a size of 34 mm × 15 cm was used and deployed into the descending thoracic aorta; the intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated. A postdeployment angiogram revealed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries.\nThe patient was postoperatively moving all his limbs, and the peripheral pulses were intact. He got discharged one day after the surgery and was doing well afterward. We evaluated patient's prognosis by following up for 3 to 6 months for a chest X-ray, CTA, and CT aorta 3D reconstruction (Figures and ) which confirmed no endovascular leak as well as no ischemic or stroke signs in the clinical follow-up; we assessed the patency of the subclavian arteries by examining the bilateral upper arms' blood supply in addition to radial arteries by evaluating the pulses with no evidence of morbidity.","{

"A 12-year-old female was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department by an orthodontist regarding an ectopic upper left canine and buccal alveolar expansion from the 22 and 24. On examination there was firm, bony expansion between these teeth with associated root displacement. The 22 and 24 were not mobile. The overlying mucosa was normal and the patient was asymptomatic.\nRadiographic examination revealed an ectopic 23 which appeared to be within the maxillary sinus or a possible large cystic radiolucency surrounding the canine as well as an indistinct area of bony expansion between the 22 and 24 (). There was no evidence of root resorption of the 22 and 24. A cone beam computed tomography (CT) was carried out and showed expanded bone in the 23 region with normal trabecular pattern with intact buccal and palatal cortices, but some buccal cortical expansion. The 23 was located in the left zygomatic bone, with the crown facing buccally and causing dehiscence of the zygomatic bone. The roots were facing toward the left maxillary sinus with the dilacerated apex projecting into the sinus (). The cause of buccal alveolar expansion and migration of the 23 was unclear.\nThe patient had the 23 region explored under a general anesthetic, as well as a bone biopsy of the lesion and a left middle meatal antroscopy. The 23 was not visible during examination of the left maxillary sinus. The expanded buccal bone appeared firm but abnormal looking with slight bleeding (). A differential diagnosis of a fibroosseous lesion was made.\nHistopathology results showed vital lamellar bone with uniform osteoblast layer with minimal evidence of resorption. The soft tissue component was a mixture of adipose and highly vascular fibrous tissue. Numerous blood vessels ranged widely in size, some having muscle wall and appeared to be displacing adipose tissue. These finding were compatible with a diagnosis of an IH.\nOn review, there was no further evidence of bony expansion or active hemorrhage from the lesion. Although the 23 was positioned in the zygomatic bone, there was no cystic evidence and therefore it was not surgically removed. No further investigations were warranted as the patient was asymptomatic. The patient is currently reviewed on a 6-monthly basis with no clinical changes. No further intervention was required for this patient as she was asymptomatic.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Right groin bulge present for 6 weeks', 'Previously repaired right inguinal hernia concern'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Right inguinal hernia repair in 1977'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Computed tomography scan', 'Finding': 'Right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Right inguinal hernia', 'Type': 'Hernia', 'Location': 'Groin'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Hernia repair', 'Details': 'Incision, reduction of appendix and omentum, incidental appendectomy, mesh plug closure'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No complications', 'DischargeStatus': 'Same day discharge'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No hernia recurrence'}}}"
"A 7-year-old boy was referred to the Clinic of Pediatric Dentistry of our University. His mother reported that yellowish coloration of his teeth made him ashamed of smiling and damaged his relationship with other children. A detailed dental, medical, and social history was obtained from the patient. His mother reported that she and the other son were also affected by the same dental disease (), but their esthetic and functional rehabilitation was performed previously.\nClinical examination revealed a mixed dentition. The permanent maxillary central incisors and permanent maxillary and mandibular first molars were partially erupted. The patient exhibited poor oral hygiene with moderate to severe dental plaque accumulation and the gingival tissues around most of the permanent and primary teeth showed mild inflammation.\nThe patient presented short clinical crowns with a generalized yellow color in both primary and permanent teeth (Figures , , and ). The enamel surface was thin and rough, whereas the roots showed normal length and form. The pulp chambers were regular in size. Carious lesions were present in the primary maxillary right first and second molars and in the primary mandibular first and second molars. In the right side the occlusion was in Class I and in the left side it was cross bite. A deep overbite was observed with premature loss of vertical dimension. In a panoramic radiography, the thin enamel layer could not be distinguished from the underlying dentin ().\nThe treatment objectives were to improve the esthetics, eliminate the tooth sensitivity, prevent further loss of tooth structure, modify the child's attitude and behavior towards dental treatment, and improve his periodontal health. As part of the treatment plan, the treatment alternatives were explained to the child and his parents.\nThe initial treatment was early orthodontic treatment interceptive and minimal intervention. The primary maxillary right first and second molars were treated before orthodontic treatment (). The caries-preventive strategies consisted of oral hygiene instruction and dietary recommendation. The permanent maxillary central incisors were restored with composite resin to improve esthetics. The restoration improved the esthetic appearance of the smile contributing to the improvement of his behavior and social conviviality (Figures –). The patient presented incipient periodontal disease, and thus professional prophylaxis for dental plaque removal was carried out every three months. These recall visits were determined by patient's risk for caries/periodontal disease.\nThe Ethic Committee of our University approved saliva collection and mutational analysis. Saliva samples were collected from the patient, his parents, and brother for DNA analysis. The InstaGene Matrix (732-6030, Bio-Rad Laboratories, United States) protocol was used to isolate genomic DNA from saliva. All amelogenin protein coding exons sequences (exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and exon 7) were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Kit (Taq DNA Polymerase, 11615-010, Invitrogen, Brazil).\nPCR amplification products were purified by use of the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (28106, Qiagen, Germany). The primers and PCR conditions shown in were used to amplify the amelogenin gene.\nFollowing purification, PCR products were sequenced using the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequence kit (4336917, Applied Biosystems, United States) and an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, United States). All products were sequenced from both directions to minimize sequencing artifacts. Amelogenin gene mutations were confirmed by repeating the PCR amplification and sequencing.\nThe electropherograms were analyzed using the SeqScape Software (Applied Biosystems, United States). The resulting sequences of direct sequencing of amelogenin gene exons were compared with the amelogenin genomic reference sequence (NC_000023.10). The variations in these sequences were checked on dbSNPs database.\nMutational analysis was performed for the coding exons of the amelogenin gene and the c.261C>T mutation was detected in samples of mother, father, and brother. This alteration is a silent mutation and a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2106416). However, this mutation was not found in the sequence of the patient ().","{

"A 28-year-old male patient was sitting next to the driver seat in a sports utility vehicle which met with road traffic accident. The sudden deceleration injury caused both the knees of the patient to hit against the dash board. The patient was taken to a level 3 trauma center and later shifted to our level 1 trauma center after 48 h of injury. On presentation, the patient was conscious, oriented and hemodynamically stable. The right thigh was deformed, painful, had abnormal mobility around thigh, and was more shortened compared to the left lower limb which was in an attitude of external rotation, there was contusion over the right gluteal region. The radiographs [] revealed a posterior dislocation of the right hip with a posterior acetabular wall fracture, an ipsilateral fracture of the shaft of the femur, reverse oblique trochanteric fracture on the left side, and a both bones fracture of the right forearm. Being a high-energy injury and in order to study the acetabular fracture morphology in detail, a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan with a 3D reconstruction of the pelvis was done which revealed acetabular fracture geometry and a minimally displaced femoral neck fracture on the left side [Figure –]. On a careful review of previous radiographs, a suspicious fracture line was seen on the left side, though it was not very clear.\nThe patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of all his fractures in the same sitting having an irreducible dislocation on one side and a femoral neck fracture on the other about 50 h from his time of sustaining injury. First with the patient in left lateral position on the right side, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the femoral shaft fracture with a locking plate and of the posterior wall acetabular fracture with a reconstruction plate and lag screws was done. A trochanteric osteotomy was also performed on the right side to aid in the fixation of the high posterosuperior acetabular wall fracture and the osteotomy subsequently fixed with three 3.5 mm cortical screws with washers. Then the patient was put over a fracture table and the ipsilateral fracture of the femoral neck and pertrochanteric fracture on the left side were treated with a dynamic condylar screw (DCS) and an additional cannulated cancellous screw []. During fluoroscopy, care was taken to ensure that all the screw threads crossed the fracture lines and compression was obtained at the neck region. Finally, the fracture of the both bones of the right forearm was fixed with low-contact dynamic compression plates (LC-DCP). It took around 6 hours for all the procedures to be completed with a blood loss of 1.2 liters and patient received 3 units of blood transfusion. Postoperatively, the patient had in bed mobilization from the second postoperative day, and started weight bearing with crutches at 12 weeks. All fractures united by 5 months, and at 28-month follow-up, the patient has no evidence of avascular necrosis, and an excellent functional outcome [Figures and ].","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Progressive fatigue and dyspnea on exertion'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalHistory': 'No significant cardiovascular disease risk factors'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Electrocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 bpm with right bundle branch block morphology'}, {'Test': 'Echocardiography', 'Finding': 'Normal left ventricular size and function with mild degenerative changes of the mitral and aortic valves'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Age-related degenerative conduction disease', 'Type': 'Degenerative disorder', 'Location': 'Heart conduction system'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Permanent pacemaker implantation', 'Details': 'Pacing lead placement in anomalous venous anatomy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Symptoms resolved following device implant'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Indefinite', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved with resolution of symptoms'}}}"
"The third patient, a 23-year-old woman with recurrent severe depression (see under results Case 3) experienced a prolonged seizure, which was stopped by intravenous application of benzodiazepine. This event mirrored the AEs, which required medical action by a doctor as reported in Case 2.\nThe young lady was a patient with an unusually high health risk for her age because of being obese and suffering from diabetes. Epidemiological studies on the relationship between diabetes and epilepsy reached discordant conclusions. However, it has been reported that metabolic abnormalities, such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, may increase the prevalence of epilepsy (). In this line, there are data-driven considerations that mechanisms for the comorbidity of obesity and epilepsy are mitochondrial dysfunction and adiponectin deficiency, which promote epilepsy, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus (). While fundamental mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and epilepsy remain a matter of discussion, hypoglycemia is an accepted reason for the occurrence of seizures in young patients with epilepsy (). The ECT patient reported here showed elevated blood sugar levels. However, a decline in the blood sugar level during the previous night and due to the ban of breakfast before ECT, which was applied in the early morning hours, could not be ruled out. While the occurrence of a prolonged seizure after the reduction of blood and brain sugar glucose level would be a possible explanation for our patient’s AE, its probability appears to be low. Epileptic seizures with changes in the blood sugar level are rare and not as common as previously assumed and require significant hypoglycemia to occur ().\nThe patient did not show any changes in her respiratory function during ECT despite being overweight. Her obesity might have been a risk factor for altered respiration, in particular when being related to upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS; ). SAS is well known to increase the risk of anesthesia-related AEs (; ), in particular when spontaneous breathing is needed during intravenous anesthesia. While being obese, no sleep-related respiratory disorder was present in this patient. Nevertheless, her case may remember doctors to consider SAS when examining a patient for ECT, and to use ambulatory screening instruments (; ) to assess SAS if necessary.","{

"A 57-year-old male with stage IV metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma who had completed a full course of chemotherapy and localized esophageal radiation about 6 months before, presented with complaints of left-sided facial pain for 3 months. The patient's pain had been progressively worsening and was significant during his chewing of solid foods, resulting in weight loss interpreted as a result of poor oral intake. The pain was described as sharp, lancinating, and throbbing, radiating to the left temple and cheek. The patient rated the severity of the facial pain as 8 out of 10 on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale.\nThe workup prior to his visit included a brain MRI and a maxillofacial CT that focused on the trigeminal nerve distribution in the brain, and facial sinuses identified no neural element involvement, metastases or bony lesions. A PET scan of the entire body at an outside hospital showed a hypermetabolic mass in the distal esophagus consistent with known adenocarcinoma.\nWith the prior diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, the patient had been on methadone, hydrocodone, and carbamazepine, prescribed by other providers. This combination of medications had failed to improve the pain severity. He was then referred to the center of pain management with the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and continuing intractable facial pain.\nOn physical examination, the patient was in considerable distress due to the facial pain. He had a palpable trigger point over the left masseter muscle. The temporomandibular joint range of motion was within normal limits and with no associated pain. A sensory examination revealed a decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left chin, the lower lip, and the lower oral mucosa, consistent with the distribution of the left inferior alveolar nerve. There was no facial asymmetry, and no other cranial nerve deficits were observed. We decided to perform a localized mandibular CT scan, on which we localized a metastatic lesion in the mandibular bone with the involvement of the inferior alveolar nerve (fig. ).\nBased on this new imaging, we reviewed his prior maxillofacial CT and PET scans. We paid specific attention to the left mandibular region because the outside facility had not mentioned an increased uptake in that region. Upon secondary review, focal uptake without any evidence of a bony lytic lesion in the left mandibular angle was noted, which likely represented evidence of early metastasis that was overlooked by prior image reading (fig. ).\nA referral to radiation oncology was issued for the localized radiation therapy of the left mandibular lesion. As part of the palliation, we decided to perform a left sphenopalatine ganglion block, which dramatically decreased the pain. The patient then received radiofrequency ablation of the left sphenopalatine ganglion based on his responses to the local anesthetic block. The combination of medications, radiofrequency, and subsequent localized radiation to the lesion provided significant pain relief. During his follow-up, he reported a pain reduction to 80% and was able to tolerate chewing the permitted semi-solid foods without pain.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of a right groin bulge present for 6 weeks', 'Initial sharp pain, now asymptomatic', 'Concern for recurrent right inguinal hernia repaired in 1977'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Repair of right inguinal hernia in 1977 without mesh implantation'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Right inguinal hernia with appendix present within the sac'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Right inguinal hernia with appendiceal involvement', 'Type': 'Hernia', 'Location': 'Right groin'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical hernia repair with appendectomy', 'Details': 'Classic oblique incision, appendix reduction, appendectomy, mesh plug closure'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No complications, discharged same day', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No hernia recurrence, doing well'}}}"
"A 71 year old man with signs of syncope and haemorrhagic shock secondary to massive haemetemesis was referred for emergency treatment and investigation to the 1st Department of Surgery, University of Athens Medical School in 2009. Eight years earlier the same patient, who had a known history of gastric ulcers, presented with a similar clinical picture to a different surgical unit. On admission he showed signs of haemorrhagic shock with a haemoglobin level (Hg) of 7 g dL. Emergency upper GI endoscopy was unable to identify the source of bleeding due to large volumes of blood in the stomach. Surgical treatment with a laparotomy was decided and the intraoperative findings demonstrated an acute gastric hemorrhage secondary to a massive propyloric ulcerative lesion. Resection of the lesion was decided and a distal gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction performed. The subsequent histology revealed a <2 cm gastrointestinal stromal tumour, with a mitotic rate of < 5 mitosis/50 per HPF, lacking necrosis and localized to the gastric mucosa. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged eleven days post surgery. The patient was reviewed over the following two years and repeat endoscopies failed to reveal any signs of recurrence. The patient subsequently declined further surveillance and follow up.\nAt his readmission in 2009 the patient was primarily treated conservatively due to his hemodynamic instability. After successful resuscitation, an emergency upper GI endoscopy was performed which revealed an irregularly shaped elevated lesion on the gastrojejunostomy line and a thrombus at the center of the lesion. The hemorrhagic lesion was situated along the posterior anastomotic suture line. Multiple biopsies were performed and a definitive endoscopic haemostasis was obtained.\nPreoperative staging computed tomography (CT) showed no lymphadenopathy or hepatic metastasis and as the patient's performance status was otherwise excellent, the decision for a second operation was deemed favorable. The patient went on to have a successful completion gastrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy and the continuity of the gastrointestinal tract was maintained through the Roux-en-Y method. It is important to note that lymphadenectomy is not routinely performed in GIST as metastatic spread rarely occurs through the lymphatic system. However the unusual presentation of the case created uncertainty over the malignant potential of the tumour and the experienced surgeons deemed lymphadenectomy the most appropriate measure in this instance. Histological review of the specimen showed macroscopically an ulcerative lesion on the suture-line, measuring 0.8 cm in diameter. The cut surface was gray with a rubbery consistency. Microscopically, it was a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (figure ), composed of spindle cells with mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism. The stroma focally had a myxoid appearance. The tumor invaded into the submucosa, showed no signs of necrosis and had positive expression of c-kit (figure ), focally positive expression of SMA, and negative expression of CD34. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient shows no evidence of recurrence 1 year and 6 months after the last surgery. It is noteworthy to mention that GIST in this patient occurred sporadically and that there were no clinical findings suggestive of familial GIST which can be seen in patients with neurofibramatosis type 1 (NF1) or in the Carney-Stratakis dyad.","{

"A 60-year-old female, laborer by occupation, a diagnosed case of carcinoma lung with metastasis presented with chief complaints of dyspnea. The patient had massive pleural effusion []. There had been five previous episodes of pleural aspiration followed by thoracocentesis. The patient was offered thoracoscopy and talc poudrage which the patient refused so an indwelling intercostal tube insertion was planned. In order not to hamper the motility a newer economical technique was employed on the lines of indwelling pleural catheter, which not only is very expensive but also not easily available in India.\nAfter detailed informed consent, the site of icd insertion site was marked by ultrasonography in the mid axillary line. The skin was thoroughly cleaned with betadine and methylated spirit. A second point was marked 5 cm behind and above the first point and lignocaine 2% was given liberally at the point of icd insertion and subcutaneously in the line between these two points. Two subcutaneous nicks were given, the first 0.5 cm behind the point of icd insertion and the second at the second point behind and a subcutaneous tunnel was created by straight artery forceps between the two points. An 18 Fr rhemsons icd tube was taken and passed through the subcutaneous tunnel and pulled out with the artery forceps. A nick was given and the front end was inserted in the chest wall as a normal icd insertion. The rear end of the tube was cut and used as an air tight cap after reversing it []. One stitch was placed at icd site and the other at the second point []. The icd was bent and dressing applied in two layers with the upper layer in two parts so that whenever drainage was to be done [], the patient removed the distal part of dressing above and connected to a bag [] and sealed the tube with the cap after drainage of fluid. The patient was mobile without any need for carrying the icd bag with icd in situ [] continuously and remained comfortable with the tube for 4 months till the end of life. During this period the patient was called for follow up every 15 days and sterile dressing was done. No complication was encountered during the above said period.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Progressive deterioration of visual function for the previous seven years', 'No other ocular symptoms reported'], 'MedicalHistory': {'StableVision': '20 / 40 since trauma to right eye at age 14'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Slit lamp examination', 'Finding': 'Diffuse haze composed of a flaky pattern of stroma throughout entire cornea'}, {'Test': 'Ultrasound corneal pachymetry', 'Finding': 'Central corneal thickness of 658 µm in right eye and 632 µm in left eye'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Congenital hereditary stromal dystrophy (CHSD)', 'Type': 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Location': 'Cornea'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Penetrating keratoplasty of right eye', 'Details': 'Corneal button sent for light and electron microscopic analysis'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Grafted cornea restored transparency within two weeks', 'DischargeStatus': 'Corneal graft remained clear after 12 months'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing monitoring', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Best-corrected visual acuity of 20 / 50 in right eye'}}}"
"A 60-year-old male who had a history of liver cirrhosis was referred for evaluation of a pain, swelling, and erythematous changes of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. His symptoms started a month ago without any specific trauma. He had a history of open reduction and internal fixation performed for a tibial plateau fracture that occurred when his left knee was pinned under a tree 18 years ago. He had sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery 8 years after the initial trauma due to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. At that time, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on plain radiographs of left leg, and obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation was observed on angiography. The patient had no difficulty with his daily life functions until the aforementioned symptoms appeared, except for limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in his foot owing to the sciatic nerve injury.\nAfter admission, the patient maintained with a long leg splint. Two weeks after the admission, the erythematous changes in the left leg localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The range of motion of the knee was 0 degrees to 100 degrees of flexion; ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees, and all of the toes had clawing deformity. As for the motor strength of the ankle, the dorsiflexion was grade 0 and plantar flexion was grade 3. He had no sensation in the first web space and on the medial aspect of the foot, and had sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.\nThe radiographs of the left leg taken 10 years ago (8 years after the initial trauma) showed a large, fusiform-shaped, radiopaque soft tissue mass in the space between the tibia and fibula that spanned from 5 cm below the proximal tibio-fibular articulation to just above the distal tibio-fibular articulation. The medial cortex of the middle third of the fibula and the posterior cortex of the distal third were sclerotic. Ten years later (18 years after the initial trauma), the patient's radiographs showed a large, fusiform-shaped soft tissue mass with extensive plaque-like and amorphous calcifications, similar to those seen in the radiographs taken 10 years earlier (Fig. ). Furthermore, we observed that calcification within the fusiform mass and in the distal part of the deep posterior compartment had increased in comparison to that seen in the radiographs taken 10 years earlier. The erosion of the medial and posterior parts of the distal two-thirds of the fibula had also increased, and a sclerotic change in the lateral cortex of the middle third of the tibia was newly observed. We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan to examine the pattern and distribution of the calcifications more closely; peripherally distributed calcification was found in the anterior compartment and in the distal part of the deep posterior compartment, and sclerotic changes were found in the tibial and fibular cortex (Fig. ). There was evidence of increased uptake between the tibia and fibula in the delayed bone phase on 3 phases of bone scan, which was determined to be caused by calcification.\nLaboratory investigations revealed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 69 mm/h and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 5.80 mg/dL with no fever. Serum calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase levels were all within the normal limits.\nWe performed an incisional biopsy to differentiated soft tissue sarcoma and no viable, malignant cells were found. A thick fluid with a chalk-like material continued to be discharged through the sinus opening. We performed an extensive debridement of the anterior and deep posterior compartments to ensure definitive treatment. Intraoperative findings showed that the deep fascia was thickened, and that the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus muscles had become necrotic and changed into a whitish, toothpaste-like material (Fig. ). Hard calcific materials resembling rice grains were spread within the necrotic muscle. Furthermore, we observed an erosion of the cortex without intramedullary involvement on the lateral tibial surface and medial fibular surface. After an en-block resection of the anterior compartment, we approached the posterior compartment through the interosseous membrane. When we opened the interosseous membrane, the turbid fluid was drained, and we found that the flexor hallucis, flexor digitorum, and tibialis posterior muscles formed a twig-shaped, hard calcification in the direction of the muscle fibers, unlike in the anterior compartment (Fig. ). Upon performing extensive debridement, we inserted a drain tube and performed primary closure. As Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in the intraoperative culture, we used antibiotic treatment (piperacillin-tazobactam, intravenously for 6 weeks and then ciprofloxacin, orally for 4 weeks). The fluid continued to be discharged through the drain even after the surgery; delayed wound healing occurred four weeks following the surgery, and there was no recurrence and the patients were satisfied with the result of the operation at follow-up conducted 2 years later (Fig. ).\nPathologic evaluation revealed that the anterior compartment specimen had acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification, and the posterior compartment specimen had fibrosis with dystrophic calcification; the tibial periosteum had acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification, and the tibial bone was fibrotic. These findings led to the diagnosis of calcific myonecrosis.","{

"A 55-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented to us with 1 month history of aimless wandering movements of his left hand. He said that he felt that his left hand was not under his control. It would act on its own will, in form of levitation of the arm, purposeless groping of objects in the surroundings. His left hand would hold objects in its vicinity and start using it, for example it would start to write if a pen was present. The left hand also showed interference in the activities of the right hand. Like when he would bring the food towards his mouth with the right hand, the left hand would try and stop it. There was also history of inter-manual conflict in form that whenever he would put his reading glasses with his right hand, the left hand would remove them. When he would button his shirt with the right hand the left hand would unbutton it. When he would wear his cap with the right hand the left hand would pull off the cap and throw it on the ground. Many a times the patient had to use his right hand to control the activities of his left hand.\nOver the last 20 days the patient started feeling that even his left leg was not under his control. While sleeping in the night the left leg would move out of the blanket and would make purposeless levitation movements. Whenever he started to walk he noticed that the left leg would step backwards. Hence he had great difficulty in walking and after effort he would drag the left leg to move forward. The patient did not feel any weakness in the left leg. There was no history of cognitive decline, myoclonus, ataxia, behavior changes, weight loss. There was no history of surgical intervention, or any toxin exposure like bismuth. Examination revealed normal speech and higher mental function. The cranial nerve and motor system examination was normal. The sensory examination showed loss of cortical sensation in form of graphesthesia, loss of two point discrimination, sensory extinction on left side of body including the face. Rest of the examination was within normal limits. Over the course of stay in the hospital (next 15 days) the patient also developed truncal ataxia, cognitive impairment, left arm myoclonus. The case was discussed as progressive left alien hand and leg syndrome. The MRI brain revealed cortical hyperintensities in bilateral frontal, bilateral parietal cortex, bilateral occipital cortex and cingulate gyrus on diffusion weighted images (DWI) []. The corresponding areas were also hyperintense on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences but less than that on DWI. The electroencephalography (EEG) done using 10-20 system showed generalized periodic triphasic sharp wave complexes of 100-150 milli second (ms) duration and inter-complex interval of 500 ms to 1 second []. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed proteins 32 g/dl, sugar 73 mg/dl (blood sugar was 80 mg/dl), Chloride 102 mM/L, cells were 2/cubic millimetre (all lymphocytes). The CSF Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) done by enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassay was raised –143.2 ng/ml (normal below 16.3 ng/ml). CSF 14-3-3 was not done due to unavailability at our center. The CSF veneral disease research laboratory (VDRL) and tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (Tb-PCR) were negative. The thyroid profile (including T3, T4, TSH and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies) was normal. Computed tomography (CT) chest, abdomen was normal. Stool for occult blood was negative. Upper and lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was normal. Serum levels of vitamin B12 and folate were normal. Serum HIV and VDRL were non-reactive. Carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, and prostate specific antigen were within normal limits. According to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (MRI-CJD) Consortium criteria for sCJD the patient was diagnosed as a case of probable sCJD [].[]\nTwo out of 1 and atleast one out of 2.\nTwo out of 1 and duration less than 2 years.\nThe patient was put on sodium valproate 500 mg twice a day for myoclonus and discharged. The patient and his relatives were not willing for a brain biopsy. The prognosis of the disease was explained to the relatives.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Primary caregiver for mother with end-stage breast cancer', 'Difficulty managing home care schedule and chores'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Diagnosis': 'ASD in adulthood'}}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)', 'Type': 'Neurodevelopmental disorder', 'Location': 'Not applicable'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Consultation and social skill training', 'Details': 'Life skills training in communication, scheduling, and managing home care tasks'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Decreased psychological stress and caregiving burden'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Five months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved ability to communicate and manage home care tasks'}}}"
"A 60-year-old woman presented to us with pain over medial aspect of right knee joint. The pain was non radiating. The pain was relieved by rest and was exacerbated by squatting and sitting cross legged. The patient had difficulty in climbing stairs. On physical examination there was tenderness along the medial aspect of knee joint and a curved scar mark was present over the anterior aspect of knee joint (). While history taking the patient told us that she had a patella fracture around 4 years back which was treated by open reduction and internal fixation and she subsequently underwent implant removal 2 years back. The patient had full range of motion (ROM) at knee joint (Figs. , ) and moderate pain was observed on medial side while flexing and extending knee joint. There was no history of any recent trauma to knee joint. A provisional diagnosis of osteoarthritis knee joint was made and weight bearing standing antero-posterior and lateral x-rays ofleft knee joint were ordered. On X-rays it was found that multiple pieces of broken circlage wire were present around knee joint and one piece had migrated posteriorly (). On examination patient did not had distal neurovascular deficit and patients pain was not related to these broken pieces, rather it was due to degenerative changes in the knee joint. It is believed that the surgeon who did implant removal removed only the K wires leaving behind the circlage wires which broke into multiple pieces over the passage of time due to the repeated stresses at knee joint. Patient was advised to undergo total knee replacement along with subsequent removal of broken hardware as potential undue complications can occur because ofbroken hardware in the form of damage to neuro vascular structure due to migration of pieces posteriorly. It was also explained to the patient that cases have been reported where broken pieces migrate to heart and sternum and produce life threatening complications. However, patient refused to undergo any type of surgery. she was warned and told to be alert whenever the nature of her pain changes or she experiences new onset of symptoms which is different in character from the pain she is experiencing now and was kept on regular follow up.","{

"A 54-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room with features of intestinal obstruction. She was constipated with evident weight loss over a period of 3 months. She was evaluated by an x-ray abdomen that revealed multiple air fluid levels and the CT – Scan of the abdomen revealed a circumferential growth involving the sigmoid colon with impending perforation and small loculated collections reaching to the superior border of urinary bladder and uterus extending to the lateral abdominal wall suggesting micro abscesses. Gastroscopy performed was normal and the colonoscopy was inconclusive due to narrowing proximal to the sigmoid colon ( and ).\nThe patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and sigmoid colectomy subsequently. The findings were an exophytic sigmoid colon tumor proliferating extraluminally with small bowel adhesions. Tumor was adherent to the lateral pelvic abdominal wall with a subcutaneous abscess pocket. Tumor perforation in sigmoid colon was noted with minimal contamination. Tumor was found infiltrating the lateral wall of uterus. No ascites, lymphadenopathy or free peritoneal/omental deposits were noted.\nThe histopathology report of the patient suggested a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a single sclerosed lymph node suggesting tumor metastasis with foreign body giant cell reaction ().\nThe patient underwent extensive evaluation by gynecology and urology departments to identify a possible primary source of malignancy in the urogenital tract. Their evaluations were negative. The patient did not have any skin lesions or ulcers suggesting skin primary as the source.\nThe patient recovered well from the surgery with parental nutrition support. She was ambulatory and was given oral feeds on 7th postoperative day. Subsequent CT Scan of the abdomen suggested a small fluid collection at the site of surgical anastomosis with few air pockets suggesting abscess formation/leakage. There was concomitant ascites, pleural effusion and a liver lesion noted too in the CT scan. Wound infection was treated with regular dressings initially and later vacuum dressing was applied. After improvement in health, enteral nutrition and wound, the patient was discharged for follow up in 2 weeks.

"A male patient aged 17 years and two months presented with a severe thoracolumbar SK. He was otherwise healthy but markedly overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 37. There was no history of spinal infections or injuries and no skeletal dysplasias. There were no associated medical co-morbidities. He had been previously followed but not treated in another spinal unit since the age of 16 years during which period his kyphosis gradually progressed and became symptomatic. On presentation in our clinic, the patient complained of persistent back pain located in the thoracolumbar junction, which affected the level of his activities. The pain did not radiate to his legs and he had no neurological symptoms.\nOn clinical examination, he had a sharply angular kyphosis of 105° with the apex in the thoracolumbar junction, as well as bilateral hamstring tightness. Neurological examination was normal. There was an associated thoracolumbar scoliosis measuring 30° and no evidence of spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. The lateral radiograph of the spine showed bridging osteophytes anteriorly across the apex of the kyphosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed when he was initially seen at the age of 16 years and showed spinal cord attenuation across the thoracolumbar junction but no cord signal change, no disc herniation and no intraspinal anomalies. There was also no evidence of the bridging osteophytes on the MRI which indicates that these developed spontaneously in order to stabilize the spine as the kyphosis progressed further and the disc spaces collapsed anteriorly. The MRI did not report fusion of the posterior elements across the levels of the kyphosis, as well as congenital vertebral abnormalities.\nIndications for surgery included severe back pain refractory to conservative measures and modification of activities, as well as the extreme degree of deformity and risk for further progression possibly causing neurological complications.\nThe patient underwent kyphosis correction at the age of 17 years and 11 months when the deformity measured 115° and only corrected to 100° on a supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster. The surgery involved a combined single-stage anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis extending from T4 to L3 with the use of posterior pedicle hook/screw/rod instrumentation and autologous rib bone graft. The anterior approach was performed through a right thoracotomy on the convexity of the scoliosis. The diaphragm was retracted distally but not divided in order to provide access to L1. During the anterior stage, the anterior longitudinal ligament was found to be ossified from T10 to L1 with bridging osteophytes extending circumferentially from T11 to T12 at the apex of the kyphosis and displacing the major vessels anteriorly. The intervertebral discs from T9 to T12 were very stenotic and immobile. The osteophytes were excised both on the convexity and concavity of the associated thoracolumbar scoliosis. The anterior longitudinal ligament was released and complete discectomies back to the posterior longitudinal ligament were performed from T7 to L1.\nDuring the posterior exposure, the spine was found to be spontaneously fused across the apex of the kyphosis from T9 to L1. There was no evidence of congenital vertebral anomalies. Extensive posterior apical closing wedge osteotomies were performed from T7 to T12. The fused facets and ossified ligamentum flavum were excised and the spine was mobilized at completion of the anterior and posterior osteotomies. The kyphosis was corrected using a cantilever maneuver with the rods simultaneously attached from proximal to distal under intraoperative spinal cord monitoring recording motor evoked potentials (MEPs), as well as cortical and cervical somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). The spinal cord monitoring signals remained stable throughout the procedure. An excellent correction of the kyphosis to 58° was achieved []. Autologous rib graft harvested during the anterior stage of the procedure was used to enhance a bony fusion across the levels of the instrumentation.\nThe patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and mobilized following application of a spinal brace to provide additional support. He was discharged 18 days after surgery. The brace remained for four months and the patient gradually returned to normal activities including sports six months after surgery. At latest follow-up, 2.6 years following kyphosis correction, the patient had no complaints of his back; he had normal activities and a BMI of 26. Radiographs of the spine showed no evidence of pseudarthrosis and no loss of kyphosis correction or junctional deformity either proximal or distal to the instrumentation.","{

"An 18-year-old morbidly obese male with no reported past medical history presented to the emergency room after a high-speed motor vehicle collision (MVA). He had been positioned in the middle of the backseat and was ejected from the vehicle. The injury was reported to have occurred 1 hour prior to presentation at the hospital. Field responders had placed the patient on a backboard and placed a cervical collar. He was resuscitated with intravenous fluids during transport. No manipulation of the extremities was completed prior to arrival. Upon arrival to the emergency room, he was intubated and sedated for airway protection due to low Glasgow Coma Scale. He had sustained facial lacerations and closed head trauma. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained showing a dislocated left hip, with the femoral head displaced into the intrapelvic space compressing the urethra (Figures and ). There was a small bony fragment noted, representing a minor acetabulum fracture, but no evidence of proximal femur fracture. He presented in critical condition due to subdural hemorrhage and was taken emergently to the operating room for a craniotomy performed by the neurosurgical team. Due to the acuity of his head injury, no other imaging of the orthopedic injuries was obtained prior to transfer to the operating room. He was already in the operating suite after completion of the craniotomy when the orthopedic team was able to evaluate the patient. Physical exam demonstrated gross deformity of bilateral lower extremities as both legs were externally rotated and shortened. On the right thigh, there was crepitus at the distal femur suggesting a distal femur fracture. Fluoroscopic imaging was obtained intraoperatively, confirming a right distal femur fracture and left hip dislocation. After receiving clearance from the trauma surgery and neurosurgery teams for further intervention on the patient at that time, the decision was made for emergent closed reduction of the left hip under general anesthesia given the intrapelvic dislocation of the femoral head in this young patient. Given the significant displacement of the femoral head, it was discussed that open reduction may be necessary, likely via a medial approach to the hip. Given the critical condition of the patient, closed reduction was preferred, if possible. The orthopedic surgery team began the closed reduction procedure approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes after presentation to the hospital and therefore approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes after injury.\nFluoroscopy was used to aid in the closed reduction. The primary surgeon began by applying gentle traction in line with the position of the left lower extremity. Due to his massive body habitus, more forceful traction was required, and a sheet was placed across his body at the level of iliac crests with an assistant pulling countertraction. Initial attempts at closed reduction using typical reduction techniques were ineffective given the position of the dislocated femoral head within the pelvis. After several minutes of traction, fluoroscopy revealed that the femoral head was still significantly displaced medially into the patient's intrapelvic region. At this time, additional countertraction, via another sheet, was placed around the left thigh and a laterally applied force was administered by another surgeon while the primary surgeon continued to apply longitudinal traction. Based off of the presumed injury pattern of hyperabduction in a frog leg position from being thrown forward into the front seats, hyperabduction and flexion combined with longitudinal traction were utilized to slowly mobilize the dislocation outside of the pelvis. Internal rotation was also used to manipulate the femoral head inferior to the ischium followed by external rotation to move the head out of the true pelvis. After significant time and effort, fluoroscopic images demonstrated that the hip was out of the pelvis and had effectively been converted to a more commonly encountered posterior dislocation. At this point, hyperabduction was no longer necessary. Instead, longitudinal traction, hip flexion, and external rotation were utilized until an audible clunk was appreciated, and a fluoroscopic image confirmed reduction of the left femoral head (). Provisional treatment of the right distal femur fracture was then administered via skeletal traction to the right lower extremity through a tibial pin. The total operating time for the closed reduction as well as traction pin in the contralateral femur was approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.\nAt this point, surgeons from other specialties took over care in the ongoing management of this polytraumatized patient and the urological surgery team was consulted to evaluate and manage any potential urethral injury from the dislocation. Placement of Foley in the trauma bay had been unsuccessful. After reduction of the hip, the urology team was able to place a Foley catheter without difficulty with return of normal-appearing urine without any evidence of hematuria. Given the ease of placement and benign appearance of the urine, no further imaging of the urinary tract was recommended by the urology service. The Foley catheter was removed later during hospitalization without complication.\nThe patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit after leaving the operating room. Postoperative radiographs and CT scan showed reduction of the left hip (Figures –). An 8 mm bony fragment from the acetabulum was again noted, which was presumed to represent an avulsion fracture from the ligamentum teres, but the scan demonstrated concentric reduction of the femoral head and no evidence of femoral fracture. Three days after presentation, the patient was weaned from sedating medications and extubated. His right lower extremity remained in skeletal traction until definitive treatment could be completed in the form of retrograde intramedullary nailing of the femur on hospital day 4, which was completed without complication. His mental status continued to improve, and he began to work with physical and occupational therapists during his admission. He was made weight bearing as tolerated on the right lower extremity but kept nonweight bearing on the left lower extremity. The patient was discharged to an acute inpatient rehab facility on hospital day 21.\nAt a follow-up visit to the orthopedic surgery clinic 9 weeks after injury, the patient reported occasional pain to the left hip and lower back after extended sitting in the wheelchair. He had continued in physical therapy as an outpatient and had been ambulating with a walker. His mental status had improved as he was now not only alert and oriented but also conversant throughout the exam. Physical exam demonstrated left hip range of motion of 0-60 degrees flexion (0-90 degrees flexion contralateral side) and 4/5 strength with hip flexion (4/5 strength hip flexion contralateral side). Distally, he was able to actively dorsiflex and plantarflex the ankle as well as flex and extend the great toe with 5/5 motor strength throughout bilateral lower extremities. Sensation was intact to light touch in superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, sural, saphenous, and plantar nerve distributions. He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulses. His gait was antalgic with a walker with decreased stance phase on the left leg. Radiographs showed concentric left hip with some irregularity noted in the femoral head concerning for osteonecrosis without femoral head collapse, as well as heterotopic ossification in surrounding soft tissues (). At this point, he was made weight bearing as tolerated on the left lower extremity and continued in outpatient physical therapy.\nThe patient returned to follow-up in clinic 4.5 months after injury. At that time, he reported no left hip pain at rest. He had continued in physical therapy on an outpatient basis. Physical exam was notable for improved strength with hip flexion of 5/5 in bilateral lower extremities but otherwise was unchanged from prior exam. An AP pelvis X-ray was obtained which showed maturation of the heterotopic ossification adjacent to the left hip (). Again noted was some irregularity in the femoral head but no evidence of femoral head collapse. An MRI of the pelvis was obtained 7 months postinjury, demonstrating focal areas of hypointensity on T1 images within the femoral head and inferior neck consistent with osteonecrosis, without evidence of femoral head collapse (Figures and ). Metal artifact from the right femur implant limited the ability of the MRI to evaluate the soft tissues in detail.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Wound dehiscence on left knee with hardware exposure', 'Progressive pain in left hip, hindering ambulation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgery': {'Type': 'Total left hip arthroplasty', 'Reason': 'Severe osteoarthritis pain'}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of femoral component'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation)'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Surgical site infection', 'Location': 'Left knee with hardware exposure'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Retained debridement and flap coverage', 'Details': 'Lateral gastrocnemius flap attempted, then replaced with latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Stable condition, successful wound healing', 'DischargeStatus': 'Enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation program'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient ambulates without assistive devices'}}}"
"The patient was a man in his 80s with no remarkable medical or family history. He presented at our emergency department with swelling and pain in the right groin. The right groin showed a swelling of 10 × 10 cm. Vital signs and blood tests were normal at the visit. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed prolapse of the small intestine into the right groin (Figure ). The hernia was located outside the inferior abdominal wall artery, suggesting an indirect hernia. The size of the hernia gate was 3 × 2 cm. The left side did not show any apparent hernias. On confirming that there was no apparent intestinal ischemia, manual return was performed and the patient was hospitalized for observation. He was discharged 3 days later, after confirmation that there were no complications such as intestinal ischemia. It was agreed upon that surgery would be performed at a later date on a watch-and-wait basis. TAPP was used to repair it. The operation was performed in a supine position under general anesthesia. On placing the 12-mm port in the umbilicus using the open method and examining the abdominal cavity, the coexistence of a femoral hernia as well as an indirect inguinal hernia was observed on the right side. Further observation of the left side also revealed an indirect inguinal as well as a femoral hernia (Figure ). Although the patient was asymptomatic, surgery was also indicated for the left side, and a simultaneous repair was then performed. Two 5-mm ports were placed in the left and right abdomen, respectively, and the operation was performed with three ports in total. The first repair was performed on the right hernia. The peritoneum was linearly incised from the outside of the hernia tract toward the hernia tract, and the space between the peritoneum and the preperitoneal fat was separated to form a space for placing the mesh. Exfoliation was performed to include the thigh ring. The inside was sufficiently dissected up to the rectus abdominis muscle, and the outside was sufficiently dissected to the right upper iliac spine. Thereafter, a Bard 3D Max Light ® mesh (10 × 15 cm) was placed and fixed to cover the inner inguinal ring, Hesselbach's triangle, and thigh ring completely. The incised peritoneum was surgically closed with 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The left hernia was repaired using the same procedure (Figure ). The postoperative progress of the patient was good, and he was discharged 2 days later. No complications or recurrence has been reported for 3 years since the surgery.","{

"Our patient was a 32-year-old gravida III para II Amhara woman who came from a rural area of North West Ethiopia. Her first delivery was an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery at home at the age of 22 years. Her second delivery was a spontaneous vaginal delivery in a health center 4 years later with early neonatal death for unknown reasons. She was seen by a health professional only once during the current pregnancy, when she experienced progressive abdominal pain 4 months prior to her delivery. She was assessed in a health center and referred to a regional hospital where she underwent an ultrasound scan and was reassured. She presented to the University of Gondar Teaching Hospital with the principal complaint of shortness of breath with associated progressive abdominal distension and pain. Her last menstrual period was unknown but she reported 9 months of amenorrhea.\nOn general examination, she looked emaciated and was slightly pale. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Her cardiovascular and respiratory system did not reveal any abnormalities. On abdominal examination her symphysis fundal height was term sized, with longitudinal lie and breech presentation. The fetal heart rate was 132 beats per minute and there were no uterine contractions. On vaginal examination the cervix was closed and uneffaced. There was no vaginal bleeding. On ultrasonography examination, there was a singleton live pregnancy with excessive amniotic fluid. The placenta appeared to be attached to the serosal surface of the fundus of her uterus and her uterus was empty. The gestational age was 40 weeks by ultrasound estimation. Her preoperative hematocrit was 34%. An emergency laparotomy was performed with the impression of abdominal pregnancy. Upon opening her abdomen and entering the peritoneum, the fetus was seen in an intact amniotic sac and there was no hemoperitoneum (Fig. ).\nOn opening the amniotic sac a live female neonate was delivered weighing 2.6kg. The uterus was ruptured at the fundus and the placenta was extensively adhered to the edge of the ruptured site, the serosal surface of the uterus and to the peritoneum and had infiltrated through the myometrium (Fig. ).\nHer fallopian tubes, ovaries and other abdominal organs were normal. The amniotic sac was attached to her bowels and her anterior abdominal wall and this was removed intraoperatively with no abdominal organ damage. There was significant bleeding after the placenta was detached from her uterus which prompted total abdominal hysterectomy to secure hemostasis and to remove the ruptured uterus. Total estimated intraoperative blood loss was 2L. She was transfused with two units of whole blood intraoperatively and postoperatively and her post-transfusion hematocrit was 27% (Fig. ).\nHer uterus was subjected for histopathology and sections from the infiltrated uterine wall show normal-sized chorionic villi, fibrin and decidual stroma. The patient and neonate progressed well and were discharged.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Substernal chest pain with dizziness and shortness of breath', 'Increasing severity of chest pain radiating to left shoulder'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalProcedures': ['Coronary artery bypass graft in 2009', 'Percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting in 2008'], 'UnderlyingConditions': ['Hypercholesterolemia', 'Hypothyroidism']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Stress test', 'Finding': 'Insignificant in 2013'}, {'Test': 'Cardiac catheterization', 'Finding': 'No narrowing or disease of vessels, patent previous grafts and stent'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'No evidence of acute or significant intracranial abnormality or bleeding'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Acute ischemic changes involving the right anterior parietal lobe'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Acute ischemic stroke', 'Type': 'Brain injury', 'Location': 'Right anterior parietal lobe'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Thrombolysis with tPA', 'Details': 'Patient eligible after repeat aPTT in normal range'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Significant improvement in left-sided weakness and facial droop', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Continuous', 'FunctionalStatus': 'NIH stroke scale improved to 1 on discharge'}}}"
"The adverse reaction to clozapine occurred in a 57-year-old married Caucasian woman with a long history of treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia (ICD10 F20) who has required continuing care in hospital for many years, due to the severity of her condition. She first developed schizophrenia at around the age of 18 and has received antipsychotic medication for almost 40 years. There is a family history of schizophrenia with her son and a maternal cousin both having the condition. Despite the recognized advantages of treating many patients with schizophrenia in community settings, her symptoms - both positive and negative - have been resistant to a range of treatments and as a consequence she has been in hospital since 1985. Periodically, the patient can also exhibit challenging behaviour that requires skilled nursing support; on occasion, she has required nursing in the intensive psychiatric care unit rather than the rehabilitation ward. The patient has been prescribed many different antipsychotics over the 40 year duration of her illness, including second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication, with unfortunately no benefit to symptoms or functioning. A trial of clozapine in June 2003 was discontinued about a month later following development of acute renal failure, when she required transfer to the general hospital unit. At that time, the renal failure was attributed to clozapine by internal medicine specialists, although the patient was also taking lithium at this time, and developed secondary lithium toxicity with a peak lithium of 2.2 mmol/L before all medication was discontinued.\nIn November 2007, after a multidisciplinary case review, it was decided that the patient might benefit from a retrial of clozapine, especially given her failure to benefit from all atypical antipsychotics available in the UK. This was considered a reasonable strategy given that the adverse renal effects seen previously when clozapine had been introduced, were thought to have been caused, or exacerbated by, lithium carbonate. Given the severe and refractory nature of the patient's condition, and taking into account the circumstances of the previous trial of clozapine, there appeared compelling grounds for a reintroduction of clozapine. The patient's concomitant medication at the time of the retrial was olanzapine 10 mg and levomepromazine 75 mg at night and sodium valproate 1100 mg per day; for acute exacerbations of psychosis, haloperidol 5 mg IM was available. This combination of medication had been utilized for several months before the clozapine retrial, without evidence of adverse effects. Before the treatment trial of clozapine, treatment with levomepromazine was discontinued. Haematology and biochemistry blood results were normal when checked 3 days before clozapine was initiated.\nClozapine was started with a dose of 12.5 mg at night. On day 2 of clozapine treatment (12.5 mg in the morning and at night), the patient complained of feeling generally unwell and on examination was tachycardic (115 beats per minute) and pyrexial (37.5°C). On day 3 (12.5 mg clozapine in the morning and at night), the patient remained tachycardic and pyrexial (38.0°C). A urine dipstick test showed a trace of protein and the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) and the patient was presumed to have a urinary tract infection and was commenced on trimethoprim, after a urine (MSSU) sample had been sent for bacteriology. On day 4, the patient's pyrexia and tachycardia persisted, and clozapine was stopped; a total of five doses of clozapine had been given. Blood biochemistry revealed a markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 197 mg/L; differential white cell count: lymphocytes 1.04 (1.3-3.5 × 109) and neutrophils 8.2 (2.0-7.5 × 109). All other results were normal including creatinine (87 μmol/L). Midstream specimen of urine showed scanty pus cells and organisms, but no RBCs, and no growth. The following day, trimethoprim was discontinued and amoxicillin commenced for a suspected chest infection. The raised temperature settled over the next few days, although the patient remained tachycardic. Blood biochemistry on day 8 showed CRP 138 mg/L, creatinine 126 μmol/L, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 mL/min/1.73 m2. Biochemistry results on day 9 were creatinine 106 μmol/L, eGFR 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 70 mm/hour. Amoxicillin was discontinued after 5 days. Renal function returned to normal over the next few days.","{

"We report the case of a 73-year-old male with bilateral THAs performed simultaneously at a different institution in 1995 using Biomet Bi-Metric stem and Ringloc cup through a posterior approach. Preoperatively, the patient had debilitating bilateral hip pain (right worse than left), and the patient reported shortening of his right leg compared to his left. The surgery was performed without complications, and the patient reported no problems with his THAs for two years with the exception that his right leg was shorter than his left. One year after surgery, the patient had a good Harris Hip Score of 87. Two years after his bilateral THAs, the patient reports developing a draining sinus tract of his left thigh () and bilateral periprosthetic infections which were not confirmed with aspiration. The patient did not want to have a revision surgery and was placed on chronic AST which was managed without the aide of infectious disease or identification of the microorganism. The patient had no risk factors for PJI.\nIn 2004, the patient was first seen in clinic and reported doing well with no hip pain but had some decreased hip range of motion and noted to have Brooker III/IV heterotopic ossification around both hips on X-ray (). He denied any systemic symptoms but was still having some drainage from the sinus of his left thigh. He was encouraged to continue his antibiotics, which at the time was amoxicillin.\nBy his next visit in 2005, the patient had started to wean himself off his amoxicillin as there had not been any drainage from his sinus tract in several months. A discussion took place with the patient in which it was explained to him that there were risks associated with discontinuing his antibiotics and that they had been beneficial in suppressing the patient's hip infection to that point in time. The patient expressed understanding and said he would continue to monitor his symptoms but was going to continue to wean himself off the antibiotics and would be sure to follow up if there were any complications.\nThe patient returned in 2015 as he wanted an update about his hip replacements. During this visit, the patient stated he did not have any pain in his hips and has had no drainage from his thigh in the previous 8 years. He has not had any fevers, chills, or systemic signs of infection. His only complaint was reduced range of motion in his hips. On physical exam, the patient had a healed up and dry sinus tract opening over the anterior aspect of his proximal left thigh, no tenderness to palpation over his hips, and no fluctuance or erythema. He had 10° of internal rotation, 15° of external rotation, and 40–50° of hip flexion bilaterally with no pain with log roll. Plain radiographs showed well-fixed bilateral total hip replacements. On the contralateral right side, there was evidence of some eccentric wear of the polyethylene liner and only minimal wear on the left side. There was no evidence of periosteal reaction, osteolysis, or cloacal openings seen anywhere along the left proximal femur. There was continued presence of Brooker III/IV heterotopic ossification around both hips without subsidence of his left hip compared to his X-rays in 2014 (). Now, twelve years after stopping AST therapy, the patient continues to have no signs of infection or loosening or wear in his hip and reports a good Harris Hip Score of 84.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of pain and limited movement in the left hand after a road traffic accident'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Distal radius fracture of the left hand'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical examination', 'Finding': 'Limited movement and crepitus in the distal radius'}, {'Test': 'Radiographs', 'Finding': 'Comminuted fracture of the distal third radius with intra-articular extension'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Distal radius fracture', 'Type': 'Fracture', 'Location': 'Left hand'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Open reduction and internal fixation through a volar approach', 'Details': 'Used 3.5 mm distal end radius locking plate for fixation'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complete bone union after four months', 'DischargeStatus': 'Returned to work without disability'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Four months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No pain or neurologic problems'}}}"
"We report the case of a 41-year-old woman with a history of presumed spinocerebellar ataxia who presented with right heart failure from an invasive mediastinal mass with near complete occlusion of her pulmonary arteries.\nShe was in her usual state of health until first presenting to the emergency department in February 2017 with bilateral lower extremity edema and progressive dyspnea on exertion. She was found to have an amorphous, invasive superior left mediastinal mass involving the main and left pulmonary arteries with occlusion of the left pulmonary arterial tree and severe narrowing of the right pulmonary artery (). At that time, she was noted to have moderate cardiomegaly with right heart enlargement and findings of elevated right heart pressures as well as several scattered, small nonspecific pulmonary nodules. Subsequent PET scan showed marked fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the anterior mediastinal mass. She underwent intravascular biopsy with interventional radiology during that first admission, and an arteriogram revealed a severely stenosed but still-patent right main pulmonary artery with no filling of the left main pulmonary artery. She was discharged with subspecialist follow-up pending biopsy results. However, initial pathology revealed only thrombus material and a minute fragment of unremarkable intima. The patient was unable to tolerate the scheduled cardiac MRI for repeat biopsy planning and was lost to follow-up until representing to thoracic surgery clinic in May 2017 after a progressive decline. At that visit, she was directly admitted for immediate further evaluation given the extent of her mass.\nOn admission in May 2017, her right heart function had declined considerably with echocardiogram notable for a severely dilated right atrium and severely dilated right ventricle with the interatrial septum bowing to the left, suggestive of right heart failure. She underwent a second biopsy via bronchoscopy; however, pathology was again nondiagnostic and notable only for fragments of fibrous tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. She then underwent a third biopsy via repeat intravascular approach that was also nondiagnostic despite seemingly adequate yield and notable only for vessel wall fragments with myxoid degeneration and few small crushed cells, favoring an inflammatory infiltrate. Although there was suspicion for sarcoma or lymphoma, the radiation oncology and medical oncology teams opted to defer empiric treatment until a definitive diagnosis was made. The cardiac surgery team felt that a biopsy via anterior chest wall window was too high risk due to the orientation of the mass. Due to the significant risk of impending hemodynamic instability from her mass, she underwent pulmonary artery stenting with the interventional radiology team, who felt that they would be able to safely stent the right pulmonary artery but could not intervene on the totally occluded left pulmonary artery. Her gradients improved immediately after stenting, and she tolerated the procedure without complication (Figures and ).\nA fourth biopsy taken at the time of stenting ultimately revealed fibrous tissue with lymphohistiocytic and plasma cell infiltrate with positive staining for S100, CD68, and CD163, negative staining for CD1a and Factor XIIIa, and emperipolesis, consistent with extranodal Rosai–Dorfman disease (). In order to rule out other disease processes, pathologic analysis revealed no significant increase in IgG4+ plasma cells and no evidence of bacteria, acid fast, or fungal organisms on Gram, Fite, AFB, Grocott, and PAS stains. Importantly, she was evaluated by the genetics team, who determined it was unlikely that her development of RDD was at all related to her presumed diagnosis of spinocerebellar atrophy.","{

"A 64-year-old female presented to the office with the complaint of a back mass. When asked to identify the location of the mass, she pointed to her right scapular line just below the costal margin. The patient reported that she first noticed this mass approximately one year prior to that visit. While it had not noticeably increased in size over the last year, the mass had recently started to produce dull pain.\nThe patient's past medical history was notable only for gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypercholesterolemia, and an overweight BMI of 29.1. When prompted, she denied any history of back trauma or back surgery. During the patient's physical examination, it was difficult to identify the mass at the location she indicated. After palpation in various positions, the mass was finally identified when she was instructed to stand and flex her back forward. In this position, a mass approximately 5 cm in diameter was palpable several centimeters inferior to the point the patient had indicated. The mass was soft and mobile with a smooth border. It was not found to be reducible. Palpation did not produce any pain during this examination.\nAt the time of this office visit, it was decided that the diagnosis of lipoma was appropriate for the patient's back mass. This decision was based on her physical findings as well as an understanding of the relatively high incidence of lipoma for individuals with this patient's chief complaint. Excision of the suspected lipoma was felt to be indicated as the mass was producing discomfort and was believed to be located such that it could be accessed by a minimally invasive approach. During preoperative examination on the day of the surgery, the patient's lumbar mass was once again challenging to identify. Palpation and marking of the mass prior to the procedure could eventually be achieved by placing the patient on her left side with her legs flexed up toward her chest. Palpation of the lumbar mass did not reveal tenderness and the exam was otherwise normal with no identified contraindications to surgery.\nFollowing induction of anesthesia and draping of the patient, an incision was made at the marked location below the 12th rib. After dissection through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the muscle, the mass could neither be visualized nor palpated. At this point, it was decided that it may be harmful to the patient to continue exploration without confidence in the location of the mass. Accordingly, the procedure was promptly terminated and the incision was closed and dressed appropriately.\nThe patient was then sent for a CT scan of her abdomen which identified a 5-6 cm right upper lumbar hernia sac containing retroperitoneal fat (). The fascial defect appeared to be 1.6 cm in diameter. There was no kidney or bowel herniating into the sac. Our diagnosis after this imaging study was that of a Grynfeltt-Lesshaft lumbar hernia.\nA new surgery was scheduled for the repair of the patient's hernia. At the start of the procedure, the horizontal skin incision present below the 12th rib from the attempted lipoma resection was opened and dissection was carried out to expose the latissimus dorsi. A plane was then created under this muscle by blunt dissection and the muscle was retracted anterolaterally to reveal herniated retroperitoneal fat protruding through a 1.5 cm diameter defect in the upper lumbar triangle (). After the hernia was detached from the deep side of the transversalis fascia, a 4.3 cm diameter circular polypropylene mesh patch designed for umbilical hernia repairs was placed under the fascia. This was anchored to the deep side of the fascia with interrupted sutures circumferentially placed 2 cm from the edges of the defect. The edges were then approximated and the defect was directly sutured closed over the mesh. At this point, a 4 cm strip of polypropylene mesh was placed over the closed defect and secured to the fascia with interrupted sutures. The latissimus dorsi was then restored to its normal position and closure of the overlying tissues was performed. The patient was discharged the same day. No recurrences of the hernia or complications have been noted on six-month follow-up.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Dysphagia for two months', 'Recurrent episodes of heartburn and dysphagia since childhood', 'Episodal and periodical esophageal discomfort', 'Mild esophageal bleeding episodes', 'Hemoptysis'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Diagnosis': 'Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB)', 'FamilyHistory': 'Sister also diagnosed with DEB'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Thickening of the esophageal wall'}, {'Test': 'Barium swallow test', 'Finding': 'Narrowing of upper esophageal lumen with diverticula'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Esophageal stenosis and diverticula', 'Type': 'Complications of DEB', 'Location': 'Esophagus'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and prokinetic drugs', 'Details': 'Administered intravenously for esophageal discomfort'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Amelioration of esophageal discomfort', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'One month', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Recommended soft consistency diet and medication'}}}"
"A 48-year-old African male was referred to our imaging department for a coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) due to a recent history of left side chest pain. Further evaluation of the patient revealed complaints of recurrent loss of consciousness for six years, convulsions for four years, a single episode of temporary loss of vision three years ago, and recent skin nodules. He is a known hypertensive patient diagnosed four years ago and is on regular medication with a fair response. He denied any known allergy or surgical history. There is no known history of tuberculosis contact or a known family history of epileptic disorders. He admitted to eating pork meat up to four times a week. He was a truck driver and is married with seven living children. This illness led him to stop driving. His wife and children are all doing well.\nThe first episode of loss of consciousness occurred suddenly and lasted for a few minutes. He denied having a prior illness. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he was treated for malaria and soon resumed normal activities.\nHe was doing well thereafter until the following year when he developed a second episode of a sudden loss of consciousness and woke up in a hospital two days later. During hospitalization, he was put on IV fluids and antimalarial drugs. This episode was followed by a severe headache that lasted for two days, temporarily relieved by acetaminophen tablets. Just like in the first episode, he had no prior illness.\nIn the third year from the onset of the first symptom, he developed an episode of generalized tonic-clonic convulsions associated with tongue biting, frothing from the mouth, and neck stiffness. This was followed by loss of consciousness. During hospitalization, he was once more treated for malaria.\nThese episodes of convulsions and loss of consciousness kept recurring yearly with increasing frequency and the duration of loss of consciousness in each episode until when he reported at our facility. In the past few months prior to presentation, he discovered having small skin nodules distributed on the neck, chest, and back. They were immobile, painless, and had no associated skin color changes (Figure ).\nPhysical examination revealed a stable adult patient, alert, afebrile, not pale or jaundiced, and with no lower limb edema. His pulse rate was 80 beats/min. Blood pressure was 141/90 mmHg. The respiratory exam revealed 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air was 99%, and bronchovesicular breath sounds were heard. Normal S1 and S2 sounds were heard on the cardiac exam. There was no murmur or thrill. Skin exam revealed few visible scattered palpable skin nodules at the neck, chest, and back. The rest of the systemic exam was unremarkable. A provisional diagnosis of disseminated cysticercosis and hypertensive heart disease was made.\nHematological tests revealed a normal range of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. His blood lipid panel, blood renal, and liver profiles were unremarkable. Sickling test, rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis, and ELISA for the human immunodeficiency virus were all negative. Electrocardiography (ECG) exam revealed a normal sinus rhythm.\nCT scan of head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed multiple cystic lesions with dot sign diffusely distributed in the brain, neck, chest, including the heart, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure ).\nCardiac CT images showed multiple hypodense cystic lesions at the interventricular septum and papillary muscles (Figure ). CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed cystic lesions (Figures , ). Excision biopsy of two subcutaneous nodules was performed and confirmed cutaneous cysticercosis on the pathological exam. A final diagnosis of disseminated cysticercosis with cardiopulmonary involvement was made based on imaging and histology.\nThe patient was treated with albendazole 400mg twice a day for two weeks, followed by 400mg once a day for two weeks, prednisone 40mg, which was tapered down, and carbamazepine 200mg twice a day for two weeks. During treatment, the patient did not complain of seizures or loss of consciousness or headache. A follow-up CT scan confirmed that the cysts had markedly reduced in number and size, and many had become non-viable (Figures , , , , ). The patient is still on albendazole 400mg once a day and is regularly seen in the outpatient clinic with no further seizures with the plan to continue the albendazole for another four weeks.","{

"The 28-year-old male patient had trained for about 2 weeks after entering a marine training center. It was said that 2-week training at the Marine training center consisted of 2–3 h of swimming training a day and 2 h of basic physical strength reinforcement training. The swimming training consisted of repetitions 50 min of swimming and 10 min of rest. The swimming portion consisted of swimming 25 m back and forth four times at full strength followed by swimming the same distance four times at low speeds. The trainees would then rest and begin again. The basic physical strength reinforcement training consisted of repeating walking and running for around 1 h followed by weight training to reinforce upper and lower extremity muscular strength. The degree of difficulty was no different for him than for his colleagues.\nDue to pain in the both hip joints and the left ankle he visited a private clinic, but although a simple radiological examination was performed no abnormal finding was found (Fig. a); anti-inflammatory analgesics were prescribed and immobilization was recommended. At 4 weeks after enrollment, he presented at our hospital due to the aggravation of his right hip joint symptoms, a simple radiological examination was performed on the hip areas reported to be painful, and the radiographs obtained revealed a displaced femoral neck fracture (Fig. b). A bone scan showed hot uptakes at both hips and at the left ankle joint, MRI revealed fractures of both femoral necks (the right side was displaced and complete fracture) (Fig. c). He underwent open reduction and internal fixation at right hip using cannulated screws. The region of ankle joint hot uptake by bone scan was also investigated and found to be due to a slight fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint and diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus on MRI. However, the patient has never made any specific complaint regarding the ankle joint. The left hip and ankle joint were treated conservatively by stabilization and long leg casting.\nHowever, reduction loss was noted 2 weeks after surgery due to non-union (Fig. a) on right hip. The displaced femur neck fracture due to fracture non union was treated by total hip arthroplasty (Depuy pinnacle cup 54 mm, ceramic liner 54–36 mm, Corail stem 314, ceramic head 12/14 medium 36 mm) and operative findings were non-specific (Fig. b).\nSuspecting multiple stress fractures, we scrutinized his history and performed a hematological examination.\nThe patient advised that he had grown in height until he was 21 years old. His body weight was 53 kg and height 170 cm, and there was no particular history of surgery or hospitalization. Seemingly, there was no finding to indicate a hormonal disorder, i.e., abnormal findings regarding early morning erection, sexual hair, etc., and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) returned a lumbar spine T score of 2.8. Findings from the hematological examination were a serum CTx (C-terminal telopeptide) 0.38 ng/ml, NTx (cross-linked N-telopeptides of type1 collagen in urine) 111 BCE/mM, 25(OH) Vitamin D3 22.3 ng/ml, PTH (intact) 27 pg/ml, LH 4.1 mIU/ml, FSH 3.7 mIU/ml, testosterone 2.79 ng/ml, osteocalcin 25.2 ng/ml, T3 (total) 121 ng/ml, free T4 1.35 ng/ml, TSH 1.42 uIU/ml, prolactin 3.5 ng/ml, alk phos 93 U/L, calcium 9.2 mg/dl, and phosphorus 4.4 mg/dl.\nAt 17 months postoperatively, the patient had a normal gait without any supportive equipment, and was pain free without functional restriction with stable fixated implants.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Transferred for descending thoracic aortic injury after attempted pacemaker placement', 'New onset atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Transient ischemic attack'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Direct cannulation of the aortic knob with the sheath'}, {'Test': 'Cerebral angiogram', 'Finding': 'Dominant right vertebral artery and left vertebral atresia'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Descending thoracic aortic injury', 'Type': 'Vascular injury', 'Location': 'Ascending aorta'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Stent graft placement', 'Details': '36 mm × 160 mm Valiant thoracic aortic stent graft deployed distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged to home on post-operative day 5'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'N/A', 'FunctionalStatus': 'N/A'}}}"
"A 43 year old female district nurse presented to the accident and emergency department with a 6 hour history of initially generalized abdominal pain which was localizing to the right. This was associated with nausea and loss of appetite, made worse by movement and not relieved with intramuscular morphine injection. There was no history of recent or past trauma to the chest or abdomen. On examination, she was tender in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa with rebound and guarding, with a Rovsing positive sign and normal bowel sounds. She was incidentally found to have some marfanoid features including the long span of upper limbs, a high arched palate and the very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The patient had a positive family history of Marfan's syndrome but had never undergone genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nA likely diagnosis of appendicitis was made on the clinical picture associated with a pyrexia and raised white cell count and C – reactive protein. Her abdominal X-ray at that time showed absence of gas in the right side of her bowel. Her chest X-ray did not show any obvious abnormality (Figure )\nShe was taken to theatre the same day for appendicectomy through a standard right iliac fossa incision. There was a small amount of free fluid but the right iliac fossa was filled with a normal looking gall bladder and small bowel only with no sign of the caecum, appendix, ascending or proximal transverse colon. The terminal ileum was found to run up under the right lobe of the liver towards the hilum. The right iliac fossa wound was closed and we proceeded to an exploratory laparoscopy.\nAt laparoscopy, the liver was retracted to see under the right liver lobe. The proximal transverse colon was found to be running up towards the liver hilum were it felt to be tethered. This suggested a possible herniation of the right colon into the chest. The procedure was abandoned and a CT thorax and abdomen were performed to define the anatomy involved.\nThis (Figure , ) demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions of moderate size with underlying unexpanded lungs. The liver had what appeared to be a large Reidl's lobe. Behind the right liver lobe, the right kidney was markedly elevated and the ileo-caecal junction appeared to lie between the liver and the kidney. The right side of the colon appeared to lie above the liver. Three dimensional reconstruction of the scans demonstrated absence of the right hemidiaphragm. (Figure , )\nThe symptoms and signs persisted and a laparotomy was performed. At laparotomy, there was some free fluid. There was definitely a large defect in the right hemidiaphragm. The right liver lobe had grown right up into the right intrathoracic space. There was a large hernial sac beneath the right lobe of the liver between the common bile duct, duodenum and liver, displacing the right kidney medially and containing transverse colon, terminal ileum, caecum, appendix and free fluid. The contents of this sac were successfully reduced and a perforated gangrenous appendix with pus was found within the intrathoracic hernial sac. A standard appendicectomy was performed. The right colon was formally mobilized, fully reduced and the caecum was fixed within the right iliac fossa.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively where she made a good recovery. She had instant relief of her abdominal symptoms and post-operative contrast study demonstrated the presence of the right colon within the abdomen (Figure ). She was discharged a week post-operatively.","{

"A 60-year-old male who had a history of liver cirrhosis was referred for evaluation of a pain, swelling, and erythematous changes of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. His symptoms started a month ago without any specific trauma. He had a history of open reduction and internal fixation performed for a tibial plateau fracture that occurred when his left knee was pinned under a tree 18 years ago. He had sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery 8 years after the initial trauma due to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. At that time, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on plain radiographs of left leg, and obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation was observed on angiography. The patient had no difficulty with his daily life functions until the aforementioned symptoms appeared, except for limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in his foot owing to the sciatic nerve injury.\nAfter admission, the patient maintained with a long leg splint. Two weeks after the admission, the erythematous changes in the left leg localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The range of motion of the knee was 0 degrees to 100 degrees of flexion; ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees, and all of the toes had clawing deformity. As for the motor strength of the ankle, the dorsiflexion was grade 0 and plantar flexion was grade 3. He had no sensation in the first web space and on the medial aspect of the foot, and had sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.\nThe radiographs of the left leg taken 10 years ago (8 years after the initial trauma) showed a large, fusiform-shaped, radiopaque soft tissue mass in the space between the tibia and fibula that spanned from 5 cm below the proximal tibio-fibular articulation to just above the distal tibio-fibular articulation. The medial cortex of the middle third of the fibula and the posterior cortex of the distal third were sclerotic. Ten years later (18 years after the initial trauma), the patient's radiographs showed a large, fusiform-shaped soft tissue mass with extensive plaque-like and amorphous calcifications, similar to those seen in the radiographs taken 10 years earlier (Fig. ). Furthermore, we observed that calcification within the fusiform mass and in the distal part of the deep posterior compartment had increased in comparison to that seen in the radiographs taken 10 years earlier. The erosion of the medial and posterior parts of the distal two-thirds of the fibula had also increased, and a sclerotic change in the lateral cortex of the middle third of the tibia was newly observed. We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan to examine the pattern and distribution of the calcifications more closely; peripherally distributed calcification was found in the anterior compartment and in the distal part of the deep posterior compartment, and sclerotic changes were found in the tibial and fibular cortex (Fig. ). There was evidence of increased uptake between the tibia and fibula in the delayed bone phase on 3 phases of bone scan, which was determined to be caused by calcification.\nLaboratory investigations revealed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 69 mm/h and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 5.80 mg/dL with no fever. Serum calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase levels were all within the normal limits.\nWe performed an incisional biopsy to differentiated soft tissue sarcoma and no viable, malignant cells were found. A thick fluid with a chalk-like material continued to be discharged through the sinus opening. We performed an extensive debridement of the anterior and deep posterior compartments to ensure definitive treatment. Intraoperative findings showed that the deep fascia was thickened, and that the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus muscles had become necrotic and changed into a whitish, toothpaste-like material (Fig. ). Hard calcific materials resembling rice grains were spread within the necrotic muscle. Furthermore, we observed an erosion of the cortex without intramedullary involvement on the lateral tibial surface and medial fibular surface. After an en-block resection of the anterior compartment, we approached the posterior compartment through the interosseous membrane. When we opened the interosseous membrane, the turbid fluid was drained, and we found that the flexor hallucis, flexor digitorum, and tibialis posterior muscles formed a twig-shaped, hard calcification in the direction of the muscle fibers, unlike in the anterior compartment (Fig. ). Upon performing extensive debridement, we inserted a drain tube and performed primary closure. As Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in the intraoperative culture, we used antibiotic treatment (piperacillin-tazobactam, intravenously for 6 weeks and then ciprofloxacin, orally for 4 weeks). The fluid continued to be discharged through the drain even after the surgery; delayed wound healing occurred four weeks following the surgery, and there was no recurrence and the patients were satisfied with the result of the operation at follow-up conducted 2 years later (Fig. ).\nPathologic evaluation revealed that the anterior compartment specimen had acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification, and the posterior compartment specimen had fibrosis with dystrophic calcification; the tibial periosteum had acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification, and the tibial bone was fibrotic. These findings led to the diagnosis of calcific myonecrosis.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Incidental finding of small nodule in lower lobe of right lung', 'Lytic lesion in fifth lumbar vertebral bone'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Lytic lesion of fifth lumbar vertebral bone and small nodule in lower lobe of right lung'}, {'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance'}, {'Test': 'CT scan after five years', 'Finding': 'Increase in size of pulmonary nodule'}, {'Test': 'MR imaging', 'Finding': 'Increase in size of lytic lesion in left transverse process of fifth lumbar vertebra'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Transitional meningioma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Lung and vertebral bone'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Video-assisted thoracic surgery for pulmonary lesion and curettage of lytic bone lesion', 'Details': 'Resection of solid lesion in lung and removal of tumor in fifth left transverse process of fifth lumbar vertebra'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good postoperative progress', 'DischargeStatus': 'Disease-free at 41 months after operation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '105 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No significant findings other than pulmonary and vertebral lesions'}}}"

"RH, a 21 year old female presented to a chiropractic teaching clinic with a chief complaint of neck and thoracic spinal pain which had been present for approximately 4 years since commencing her university studies and was aggravated by studying. RH experienced this pain about once per week and it lasted for 'a couple of days'. RH had a secondary complaint of headache, which began about the same time as her primary complaint. The headaches were described as a band of pain across her forehead along with an ache at the base of her skull and in her temples. Past medical history was unremarkable save for shingles in 2004. Routine physical examination was unremarkable. Following history and examination a working diagnosis of mid-back pain of mechanical origin with associated muscle hypertonicity was established and a course of chiropractic treatments proposed. Treatment included SMT to the spinal levels thought to have restricted motion, soft-tissue treatment to the musculature of the upper back and a recommendation for core stability exercises. On a subsequent visit RH reported that she could neither lie prone on the treatment table nor could she perform even the most basic core stability exercises because to do so would result in severe abdominal pain, throat tightness and headache. Following further questioning it was determined that RH had been experiencing this triad of symptoms since she was eight years old and had subsequently avoided any activity that placed pressure on her abdomen, such as sitting close to a table when studying or performing abdominal exercises. Medical investigation for her symptoms had yielded neither a diagnosis nor a treatment. RH traced her symptoms back to a ballet class when she was age eight years during which she was required to lie prone on a wooden floor and, while holding onto her ankle, attempt to touch her toes to her head. Palpation of the area surrounding RH's xiphoid reproduced her abdominal pain and throat tightness immediately with the headache beginning a few minutes later. These symptoms persisted for several hours. A diagnosis of xiphodynia was established and a course of LLLT suggested. Four treatments of 2 minutes each were administered. RH reported a lessening of her symptoms but not cessation. It was noted that, in order to reproduce the symptoms pressure had to be applied to the xiphoid for up to 20 seconds and that RH's symptoms would not begin for until two minutes after pressure was removed. A switch of modality to Ultrasound was commenced. Ultrasound was chosen because of its known effects on tissue repair [,]\nIn addition, RH was advised to use a topical anti-inflammatory gel over the xiphoid. Following four ultrasound treatments RH's symptoms persisted however they have subsided from 8/10 to 2–3/10 and she is content to continue with conservative care because she does not wish to receive an injection of corticosteroid to the area. RH was reviewed in April 2007 and related that she went overseas during the University summer break during which time her symptoms continued to subside. RH stated that her symptoms were mild and intermittent. At this point in time RH elected to have no examination or treatment of the xiphoid, instead opting to return for assessment and treatment if she experienced an exacerbation of symptoms.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Wound dehiscence on left knee with hardware exposure', 'Progressive pain in left hip with difficulties in deambulation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Total left hip arthroplasty at age of 74 due to severe osteoarthritis pain'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of femoral component'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation)'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Infection following revision total hip arthroplasty', 'Type': 'Post-surgical complication', 'Location': 'Left hip'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Retention debridement and wound coverage with flap', 'Details': 'Flap surgery with latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap and AV loop reconstruction'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Able to ambulate without assistant devices'}}}"
"A 60-year-old male who had a history of liver cirrhosis was referred for evaluation of a pain, swelling, and erythematous changes of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. His symptoms started a month ago without any specific trauma. He had a history of open reduction and internal fixation performed for a tibial plateau fracture that occurred when his left knee was pinned under a tree 18 years ago. He had sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery 8 years after the initial trauma due to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. At that time, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on plain radiographs of left leg, and obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation was observed on angiography. The patient had no difficulty with his daily life functions until the aforementioned symptoms appeared, except for limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in his foot owing to the sciatic nerve injury.\nAfter admission, the patient maintained with a long leg splint. Two weeks after the admission, the erythematous changes in the left leg localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The range of motion of the knee was 0 degrees to 100 degrees of flexion; ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees, and all of the toes had clawing deformity. As for the motor strength of the ankle, the dorsiflexion was grade 0 and plantar flexion was grade 3. He had no sensation in the first web space and on the medial aspect of the foot, and had sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.\nThe radiographs of the left leg taken 10 years ago (8 years after the initial trauma) showed a large, fusiform-shaped, radiopaque soft tissue mass in the space between the tibia and fibula that spanned from 5 cm below the proximal tibio-fibular articulation to just above the distal tibio-fibular articulation. The medial cortex of the middle third of the fibula and the posterior cortex of the distal third were sclerotic. Ten years later (18 years after the initial trauma), the patient's radiographs showed a large, fusiform-shaped soft tissue mass with extensive plaque-like and amorphous calcifications, similar to those seen in the radiographs taken 10 years earlier (Fig. ). Furthermore, we observed that calcification within the fusiform mass and in the distal part of the deep posterior compartment had increased in comparison to that seen in the radiographs taken 10 years earlier. The erosion of the medial and posterior parts of the distal two-thirds of the fibula had also increased, and a sclerotic change in the lateral cortex of the middle third of the tibia was newly observed. We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan to examine the pattern and distribution of the calcifications more closely; peripherally distributed calcification was found in the anterior compartment and in the distal part of the deep posterior compartment, and sclerotic changes were found in the tibial and fibular cortex (Fig. ). There was evidence of increased uptake between the tibia and fibula in the delayed bone phase on 3 phases of bone scan, which was determined to be caused by calcification.\nLaboratory investigations revealed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 69 mm/h and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 5.80 mg/dL with no fever. Serum calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase levels were all within the normal limits.\nWe performed an incisional biopsy to differentiated soft tissue sarcoma and no viable, malignant cells were found. A thick fluid with a chalk-like material continued to be discharged through the sinus opening. We performed an extensive debridement of the anterior and deep posterior compartments to ensure definitive treatment. Intraoperative findings showed that the deep fascia was thickened, and that the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus muscles had become necrotic and changed into a whitish, toothpaste-like material (Fig. ). Hard calcific materials resembling rice grains were spread within the necrotic muscle. Furthermore, we observed an erosion of the cortex without intramedullary involvement on the lateral tibial surface and medial fibular surface. After an en-block resection of the anterior compartment, we approached the posterior compartment through the interosseous membrane. When we opened the interosseous membrane, the turbid fluid was drained, and we found that the flexor hallucis, flexor digitorum, and tibialis posterior muscles formed a twig-shaped, hard calcification in the direction of the muscle fibers, unlike in the anterior compartment (Fig. ). Upon performing extensive debridement, we inserted a drain tube and performed primary closure. As Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in the intraoperative culture, we used antibiotic treatment (piperacillin-tazobactam, intravenously for 6 weeks and then ciprofloxacin, orally for 4 weeks). The fluid continued to be discharged through the drain even after the surgery; delayed wound healing occurred four weeks following the surgery, and there was no recurrence and the patients were satisfied with the result of the operation at follow-up conducted 2 years later (Fig. ).\nPathologic evaluation revealed that the anterior compartment specimen had acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification, and the posterior compartment specimen had fibrosis with dystrophic calcification; the tibial periosteum had acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification, and the tibial bone was fibrotic. These findings led to the diagnosis of calcific myonecrosis.","{

"An 87-year-old woman presented to the accident and emergency department after sustaining a fall while on holiday. She complained of pain and reduced range of movement in her left shoulder. Her past medical history included hypertension atrial fibrillation, for which she took aspirin 75 mg once a day. She had previously undergone a thyroidectomy in 2000 for hyperthyroidism. She was otherwise fit and well with no known drug allergies.\nOn examination her left arm was bruised and painful when movements were attempted. Her distal neurovascular status of the affected limb was normal with no deficit detected. Plain film radiographs of her left shoulder demonstrated a minimally displaced and impacted fracture of her proximal humerus (as shown in ). After discussion with the orthopaedic registrar on call she was placed in a collar and cuff and sent home to attend the next available fracture clinic.\nWhen she was reviewed in the following fracture clinic it was noted that she had developed a swelling and erythema on the left side of her neck in the distribution of her external jugular vein (as shown in ). It was also found that the collar and cuff had been applied rather tightly. She was referred to the on call ENT registrar who made a diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of her external jugular vein. Further questioning did not reveal a history of further thrombotic events. The ENT registrar felt the erythema may be developing cellulitis and so started the patient on antibiotics (flucloxacillin 500 mg four times a day for 5 days) and placed her in a better fitting sling. The fracture was deemed suitable for nonsurgical management with regular clinical and radiological follow-up. As she was only on holiday in the region, further follow-up was arranged for two weeks in her local hospital.\nTwo days later, she represented to the accident and emergency department with pain and gross pitting oedema in her left arm. A Doppler scan demonstrated near complete occlusion of the left subclavian and axillary veins consistent with a deep vein thrombosis. She was started on warfarin covered with treatment dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg once a day) until her INR was therapeutic. As the external jugular vein thrombosis was thought to be triggered by her collar and cuff, the decision was made to anticoagulate the patient for 3 months.\nThe patient made a full recovery and so far has had no further episodes of thrombosis. While this episode of thrombosis did not significantly impede her rehabilitation, it was a potentially life-threatening complication that perhaps could have been diagnosed earlier in her care.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Wound dehiscence on left knee with hardware exposure', 'Progressive pain in left hip hindering deambulation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Total left hip arthroplasty at age 74 due to severe osteoarthritis'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of femoral component'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Femoral pseudo-tumor'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Infection post hip revision surgery', 'Type': 'Postoperative complication', 'Location': 'Left knee with hardware exposure'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Revision total hip arthroplasty with reconstruction ring', 'Details': 'Cemented dual mobility cups and antibiotic spacer'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Proper wound healing and initiation of rehabilitation', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable and transferred to outpatient rehabilitation program'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Ambulating without assistance devices'}}}"
"A 35-year old adult, high school educated, married male, tailor by occupation, of lower socio economic status presented to the psychiatry outpatient department of University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, a tertiary care center in the capital city of Delhi. He was referred from the medical department for complaints of increased water intake with two episodes of abnormal movements. Abnormal movements were characterized by sudden tightening of limbs and jaws with jerky movements with urinary incontinence and loss of consciousness one month prior to the visit. Patient was evaluated and found to have low serum sodium levels. The jerky movements were attributed to hyponatremia induced seizure due to increased water intake. On elicitation of history from patient, his wife and his brother who accompanied him, reported that patient was apparently functioning well until 2 to 3 years ago when he had an episode of fever following which he started reporting complaints of weakness and anxiety. He reported that he was advised by the doctor to drink fluids, following which he initially started taking increased amounts of water per day and gradually the intake was raised to about 10 liters / day. He started feeling thirsty while talking or after micturition and there was a need to drink water after every five to ten minutes and also, after whenever he passed urine. He reported that he would feel anxious and irritable if he was unable to get water or if family would stop him from taking water. His appetite had decreased and he had suffered loss of weight over the period of 2 years and had thoughts preoccupied with water intake. He would always keep a 2 liter bottle of water with him. He also lost interest in work and stopped going to work, citing weakness and fatigability all through the day as the reason for absenteeism from work. There was no history of sadness of mood or any other depressive symptoms. No psychotic symptoms could be elicited and no other obsessive thoughts, images or impulses or any other compulsive behavior was present. No history of any organic cause was found. History of smoking was present but he was abstinent for the past 2 years. Past and family history was insignificant. No significant medical history was obtained. Premorbid personality was of an extrovert, cheerful, conscientious, religious adult. He was treated with paroxetine 12.5 mg which he had taken for a few days but had reported no improvement in water drinking and had probably increased the risk of low sodium levels leading to seizure. On Mental Status Examination, patient was conscious, oriented, asthenic built, cooperative, had a 2 liter bottle of water which was half filled (he reported to have finished about 3 liters before the visit in about 4 to 5 hours), and he was taking regular sips from the bottle after almost every few sentences, reporting inability to stop drinking water even when asked to, complaining of feeling thirsty as he spoke, psychomotor activity and speech was normal, preoccupations with drinking water, he appeared anxious with no perceptual abnormality. Differential diagnoses included Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti Diuretic Hormone (SIADH), diabetes insipidus, hyperthyroidism, and excess cortisol and psychogenic polydipsia were considered.\nPatient’s complete hemogram, thyroid function tests, liver function and renal function tests (except serum sodium), blood sugar, urine routine, CT scan brain were found to be normal. Values of serum sodium were low when he was evaluated at the time of seizure. Mild hepatomegaly and bilaterally mildly enlarged kidney were seen on ultrasound of abdomen. Sodium osmolarity was 145 mosm/kg, urine osmolarity was 285mosm/kg. Cortisol levels were normal. No diurnal body weight gain was noted. These findings rule out the possibility of organic causes and the patient was managed on the lines of psychogenic polydipsia (R63.1 according to ICD-10).\nPatient was on treatment initially with vasopressin receptor antagonist (tolvaptan) 30 mg in divided doses which was tapered off after sodium levels were stabilized by the physician. He was started on olanzapine 2.5 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg for antianxiety effects. Behavior therapy for compulsive water drinking was planned with the patient and brother as co therapist. He was advised to keep a log diary of intake and output for fluids. He was advised to reduce his water intake by keeping a watch on his input/output chart. Family as well as the patient was psycho-educated regarding effects of increased water intake and the need to restrict water intake. This helped family members to stop him from drinking excess fluids even when he would become irritable if restricted. In a span of 6 weeks follow up, he showed remarkable improvement in his water drinking, reduced from 10 liters approx. to 5 liters / day as seen by input/output charting made by the patient and supervised by his family members. His anxiety levels were also reduced and he was motivated and started to go to work. He reported feeling better and motivated for treatment with further reduction in water intake. Patient was advised to gradually stop olanzapine and clonazepam and to continue with behavior therapy (Fig).","{

"A 54-year-old male presented with masses on his left arm and axilla. The axillar mass was 12 × 7 cm and the mass in the proximal lateral humerus was 6 × 5 cm. His symptoms had started a number of years prior. Before the initiation of these symptoms, he denied having any significant medical problems. He had a history of smoking for 20 years. In his family history, no relevant medical condition and/or history of cancer was identified. He had been referred to a surgerical clinic three years prior in which he had a biopsy of the tumor reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma. It appears that he had been evaluated only for possible intestinal primaries at that time and having failed to identify the primary, had been sent to receive radiotherapy of unclear dosage. After the recurrence of his tumor, he was referred to the medical oncology department at our hospital with a mass in the left thoracic region and another in the left humerus, visible on X-rays (). His examination revealed a mass in his left breast besides the aforementioned ones. His biopsy materials were reevaluated in our pathology department and confirmed to be metastatic adenocarcinoma. The report also indicated that the mass might be breast originated, raising the suspicion towards a possible breast primary. He was then given neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and capecitabine for six cycles following the decision of our tumor council.\nAn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was obtained following the cessation of his chemotherapy revealing a 140 × 100 × 90 mm lobulated mass in the proximal epiphyses, metaphysis and diaphysis of the left humerus, which was destructing the cortices on multiple sides with a large soft tissue component, and invading and protruding out of the skin ().\nAnother mass, 123 × 54 × 74 mm in size, was located in the axillary region adjacent to the thoracic wall infiltrating the skin, surrounded by multiple nodular masses of different sizes. These masses also invaded the brachial plexus and the vessels. There were other masses also in his pectoral muscle, as well as in his scapular muscles. Medullar intensity of the scapula appeared to be normal. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and an MRI of the brain failed to demonstrate any other metastasic lesions.\nAt the end of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocol, the patient was in intractable pain. He was under a combination analgesic treatment that consisted of ibuprofen (3 × 400 mg), tramadol (4 × 50 mg) and pethidine (1 × 75 mg). His pain scales (out of 10) were 8 to 9 in the mornings and 9 to 10 at night, severe enough to awaken him from his sleep. The status of the patient was discussed amongst the tumor council of our hospital consisting of orthopedic surgeons, radiologists, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists, who decided that amputation would be the best option for the management of the patient's pain and impaired function.\nThe radical nature of the procedure as well as the risks and benefits were discussed with the patient and his family and the patient consented to undergo the operation. The operation was performed by a team of orthopedic, general and plastic-reconstructive surgeons.\nHe was intubated and placed in a right lateral decubitus position. The skin incision was marked in close consultation with the general and plastic surgeons ().\nSkins flap were elevated superiorly to the clavicle, inferiorly to the costal arch, and medially to anterior midline. The lateral border of the skin flaps was latissimus dorsi muscle, inferiorly; and the supero-medial border of the mass, superiorly. Dissection of the pectoralis major muscle was started from the medial side at the origin from the sternum as the insertion was also invaded by the mass. Dissection was then directed to the thoracic wall to excise all the breast tissue, pectoral muscles and the soft tissues, including the periosteum of the ribs without exposing the tumor. The subclavian vessels were ligated and divided. The exposure was continued laterally and posteriorly up to the insertions of rhomboid muscles. Finally, the upper extremity, all together with the mastectomy material, was removed including the scapula, inevitably creating a big tissue defect (). The defect was closed with full thickness skin graft and application of vacuum assisted closure (V.A.C. Therapy, KCI Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) ().\nThe histopathological observation of the amputation material was then carried out. His biopsy from the excised mass revealed infiltrative ductal carcinoma with negative surgical margins. The specimen consisted of 70 cm of upper extremity and scapula and breast tissue attached to it. Multiple nodules were detected and the biggest nodule was 13 cm in diameter. The axillar region was completely infiltrated with tumor and ulcerated. There was another ulcerated region of 6 × 5 cm in the lateral proximal humeral region. There was another nodule of 0.5 cm in the medial side of the elbow. The tumor was negative for estrogen receptor, c-erbB2 and GCDFP-15, and 1% positive for progesterone receptor. In Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) studies conducted with DNA probes (REPEAT-FREE POSEIDON FISH DNA Probes, Kreatech Diagnostics, Amsterdam, Netherland) HER-2 gene amplification was not manifested.\nThe patient was monitored in the post anesthesia care unit for a few days until he was stabilized and then transferred to our clinic. In the early post-operative period his pain medication was ibuprofen (3 × 400 mg) and tramadol (2 × 50 mg), with the addition of morphine patient controlled analgesia for the first two days. His pain scales, out of 10, were between 4 to 6 both during the day and at night. He was discharged from the hospital when the wound healed after two weeks (). His outpatient progress was monitored during the first, third, sixth and twelfth weeks post-operatively. In the third and the sixth week controls, the patient reported that he was experiencing reduced levels of pain and had therefore lessened his intake of pain medication; he was only taking ibuprofen (3 × 400 mg). In the control during the twelfth week the patient reported that he was almost entirely pain-free. Unfortunately, a lung metastasis was then discovered at six months. The patient, refusing to receive any further chemotherapy, passed away eleven months after surgery.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Scheduled for bilateral total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis', 'Chronic Hepatitis C virus infection'], 'MedicalHistory': {'ChronicConditions': ['Hepatitis C virus infection']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Pelvis radiograph', 'Finding': 'Rapid destruction of the hip joint'}, {'Test': 'Synovial biopsy', 'Finding': 'Fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, osteoclast giant cells'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Bilateral Rapidly Destructive Osteoarthritis (RDO)', 'Type': 'Degenerative joint disease', 'Location': 'Hips'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Bilateral total hip replacement', 'Details': 'Uncemented prosthesis in right hip, cemented stem and cup in left hip'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Favorable, no signs of infection', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged with pending microbiological results'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Regained full activity, gait independence without pain'}}}"

"A 39-year-old female presented to the outpatient clinic with the complaints of recurrent painless swelling in the left thigh and had a history of surgery twice for its removal. She was apparently well until 2001 when she noticed a painless swelling over left mid-thigh. The swelling progressively increased in size and she underwent surgical excision in 2005. She remained asymptomatic for the next 2 years when she again noticed a new swelling over the left distal thigh which was excised surgically in 2009. She remained asymptomatic for the next 3 years when she had a recurrent swelling over the left distal thigh. The swelling was progressively increasing in size and was associated with some discomfort. At the time of presentation to us, she had a large, oval, around 8 cm × 4 cm size, painless swelling over the medial aspect of the left distal thigh. There was a healed scar over the left medial thigh with quadriceps wasting. The swelling was intramuscular on clinical examination. Systemic examination was unremarkable. She was further evaluated with radiographs of the thigh which was suggestive of fibrous dysplasia. This led us to go for a thorough skeletal survey, which showed the involvement of the left femur and tibia (). She was also evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of whole of the thigh which showed two additional soft tissue masses; one in left mid-thigh and the other in the left inguinal region (). As the previous biopsy report was suggestive of myxoma, clinical diagnosis of Mazabraud’s syndrome was made. The patient decided for operative management of the large distal thigh symptomatic swelling and conservative management for the remaining two small, asymptomatic swelling. After informed consent, she underwent wide excision of the distal thigh swelling through the previous skin incision. The mass was intramuscular, located within vastus medialis. A single, globular, pale white, encapsulated nodular mass measuring 8 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm was excised (). The mass weighed around 88 g. Histopathological examination was suggestive of intramuscular myxoma (). No necrotic areas or atypical mitotic figures were identified, ruling out any malignancy. The patient was managed with weekly oral bisphosphonates for fibrous dysplasia, which was stopped after 1.5 years. A regular MRI every 6 months was advised to assess the recurrence and interval enlargement of the remaining two lesions. On follow-up, MRI was done 6 months postoperatively, and these two masses seemed to have slightly increased in size; however, the patient remained asymptomatic (). At latest follow-up after 2 years, the patient was pain free with no recurrence and the MRI showed decrease in the size of the mid-thigh lesion and minimal increase in the size of the left inguinal lesion ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Staphylococcus aureous infection of endocardial pacing system'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastMedicalHistory': ['Mild dilated cardiomyopathy', 'Ventricular tachycardia', 'Biventricular endocardial pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'Previous percutaneous endocardial pacing system implantations via right and left subclavian veins']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Staphylococcus aureous infection of endocardial pacing system'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical implantation of new epicardial pacing system'}, 'PostoperativeCourse': {'Recovery': 'Good', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on day 4 post-operation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Post-operative follow-up', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Well functioning biventricular pacing system'}}}"
"An 80-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with a history of chronic abdominal pain and weight loss of 10 kilograms in the past six months. The patient was postmenopausal for 30 years and had a free medical history. Physical examination revealed no tenderness, but a hard and mobile mass palpable in the right iliac fossa. Further investigation by means of transvaginal ultrasound revealed a cystic formation, sized 83 × 65 × 64 mm in the right adnexal area. The mass was of mixed structure, comprising of solid and cystic areas. The wall was smooth and anechoic on ultrasound imaging. No papillary projections or septations were identified and there were no signs of blood flow during the color Doppler evaluation. The left ovary was illustrated measuring 25 × 13 × 11 mm, but the right ovary could not be visualized (Figures and ). A polyp of the endometrium was also recorded, with total endometrial thickness of 8 mm. No free fluid was seen in the Douglas pouch. However, it was inconclusive whether the mass originated from the right adnexa or it concerned a uterine necrotic leiomyoma that protruded towards the adnexa. Because of the indeterminate ultrasound findings, an abdominal CT scan was carried out which identified a cyst sized 100 × 80 mm with signs of peripheral calcification attributed to a lesion of the right ovary (Figures and ). As a routine investigation, when an ovarian tumor is suspected, our patient underwent colonoscopy, during which a benign polyp of the sigmoid colon was excised; also a submucosal round smooth cystic formation of one cm in diameter at the site of the appendix was identified. Tumor markers were within normal limits, with the exception of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA: 54, 2 ng/mL).\nThe patient underwent laparotomy with the diagnosis of a pelvic mass, in which a cystic tumor originating from the appendix, sized 80 × 90 mm, was identified, whereas the uterus and ovaries were atrophic. The abdominal viscera were covered with surgical pad gauzes to protect from spillage of the cyst contents. However, several intestinal loops adhered to the cyst, and despite meticulous dissection, the cystic mass ruptured intraoperatively. Frozen section was performed, which revealed malignant mucinous neoplasm. Appendectomy, omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingooophorectomy were performed, in collaboration with the General Surgery Team of the hospital. The histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm with focal invasion of the muscle layer (Stage I-T2N0M0, WHO Classification 2010), without desmoplastic reaction. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital one week later. Soon afterwards she underwent six cycles of chemotherapy and up to present, 12 months after surgery, she remains in good health.","{

"An 18-year-old female patient reported to our department with the complaint of poor esthetic appearance due to missing upper and lower front teeth since 4 years and seeking prosthetic treatment. Patient gave no history of trauma and extractions in relation with the missing teeth. The patient reported that the teeth exfoliated due to loosening. The patient's medical history was not contributory. Family history revealed no such abnormality among other family members.\nOn intraoral examination [] the morphologic appearance and color of the permanent teeth were normal. In maxillary arch, the missing teeth were from right canine region to left canine region and in mandibular arch, all the incisors were missing. There was generalized grade II and grade III mobility. Oral hygiene was poor and there were plaque and calculus deposits in all the quadrants. Restorations were present in left maxillary first molar and mandibular second molar.\nPanoramic radiograph [] revealed adequate enamel thickness on the cuspal tips of all the teeth. There was no root formation in most of the teeth while some of the teeth exhibited short, blunted and malformed roots of only a few millimeters with obliterated pulp chambers. The mandibular first left molar tooth had taurodontism like appearance. Well-defined periapical radiolucencies were present in association with the apex of the mandibular left first molar and right first and second molar.\nAlthough the patient had attained her physical maturity and was ready for definitive dental treatment but her physical, financial and psychological situations were important to be considered in selecting the final treatment plan. The following treatment plan was formulated for the patient. Dietary and oral hygiene instructions were given to the patient and extraction of the teeth that were mobile was advised along with the rehabilitation of the missing teeth with prosthesis.\nThe right maxillary first molar tooth was extracted and sent to Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. Clinical examination of the gross specimen [] revealed an intact tooth. The tooth crown was of normal dimensions measuring around 7.5 mm but the roots were short and measured about 6 mm. The specimen was sectioned mesiodistally into halves. The mesiodistally cut tooth surface showed total obliteration of pulp chambers with dentin. One half of the cut tooth specimen was decalcified in 10% nitric acid and processed for hematoxylin-eosin (H and E) staining. Other half of the cut tooth specimen was used for preparing ground section.\nThe ground section [Figure and ] showed normal crown outline with normal enamel covering. A thin layer of superficial mantle dentin appeared but the pulp chamber was totally obliterated by an unusual calcified material consisting of atypical tubular dentin and osteodentin covered by thin discontinuous layer of cementum. Normal dentinal tubule formation appeared to have been blocked and the new dentin so formed around obstacle, gave rise to the characteristic appearance of “lava flow around the boulder” [].\nHistopathologic examination of the decalcified hematoxylin-eosin section [] showed total obliteration of pulp that was filled with tubular dentin, osteodentin and irregular, globular masses of dentin [Figure and ]. A cluster of odontoblasts was seen within the globular masses of dentin.\nBased on the clinical, radiographic, gross features and histological examination of the ground section and decalcified section, diagnosis of dentin dysplasia type I was made.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain and swelling about the left knee', 'Valgus posture of both lower extremities'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Struck in the left knee by a basketball'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee'}, {'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'High-grade synovial cell sarcoma'}, {'Test': 'CT of the chest', 'Finding': 'Negative for metastasis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Synovial cell sarcoma', 'Type': 'High-grade', 'Location': 'Lateral aspect of the left knee'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Wide local excision with brachytherapy and external beam irradiation', 'Details': 'Implant dose of 2480 cGy, external beam dose of 5040 cGy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Moist desquamation at radiation therapy portal', 'DischargeStatus': 'Home on last day of treatment'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Nearly 4 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Significant valgus deformity requiring corrective osteotomy'}}}"
"A 39-year-old female patient was referred to our Nephrology Department during late 2009. She was newly diagnosed with SLE after a spontaneous miscarriage during the second trimester of pregnancy. Due to significant proteinuria and microscopic hematuria a kidney biopsy was performed which revealed crescentic focal segmental glomerulonephritis [class III lupus nephritis with crescents according to WHO classification ()]. She was initially managed with a combined therapeutic regimen of cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids and azathioprine which was modified due to poor response, to mycophenolic acid with the addition of rituximab. However, despite the absence of extra-renal manifestations of lupus, kidney function gradually deteriorated and patient reached ESKD about 4 years after the initiation of immunosuppression. Peritoneal dialysis was the type of renal replacement therapy that was initiated with the concomitant administration of hydroxychloroquine and low dose methylprednisolone.\nShortly after the induction of peritoneal dialysis, the patient presented with fever for the first time. All possible infectious causes were investigated including peritonitis, catheter related infection and a lupus flair, nevertheless no definite diagnosis was reached, and she was managed with empiric antibiotic treatment that led to full recovery. During the next 12 months she had 3 more hospitalizations with fever as main cause of admission and all workups were inconclusive except her last admission when high CMV viral load with 157.000 copies/mL was found. Further investigation revealed remarkably low serum immunoglobulin levels and five pulses of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. In this direction, supplementary investigation for hypoglobulinemia was performed with repetitive measurement of immunoglobulin levels after a symptom free period which confirmed earlier findings with low IgA, IgG and IgE levels but slightly elevated IgM levels (). Then on, patient had no major complications apart from two to three episodes of upper respiratory infections and acute tonsilitis each year. Evaluating both clinical course and laboratory findings the monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated as acquired immunodeficiency was the most likely cause. The regimen was well tolerated.\nIn June 2020, the patient received a cadaveric kidney transplant. The compatibility analysis revealed two shared HLA class I antigens and the donor was CMV IgG positive. Immunosuppression regimen included basiliximab 25 mg on day 0 and 4, mycophenolic acid 540 mg twice daily, tacrolimus with trough levels of 8 ng/ml directly post-operatively and methylprednisolone as well as prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir. There was direct allograft function postoperatively and no need for renal replacement therapy. The only remarkable manifestation post-transplant was a lymphocele that was surgically managed with a peritoneal window drainage.\nTreatment with IVIG was continued seamlessly and a change in immunoglobulin profile was noticed (). In more detail, IgG CMV antibodies that were absent even after the resolution of her former CMV infection were detected. Of note, our patient had also failed to acquire immunity for hepatitis B after vaccination, but HBV surface antibodies were now present. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping with flow cytometry appointed an almost absent CD20+ lymphocytes count (0.11%, 2 cells/μl).","{

"A 60-year-old male patient reported to the clinics with a chief complaint of vesicular eruptions on the left side of the face since 5 days. Past medical history was not contributing and the patient reported burning sensation in the affected area. The localization and distribution of the skin findings were distinctive and presented as ulcers ranging from 4 mm to 0.5 cm interspersed with crustaceans, extending on the left half of the face, characteristically not crossing the midline []. Intraoral examination revealed similar vesicular eruptions on the left side of the mid-palatine suture involving the hard and soft palate, not crossing the midline. Based on the clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed as herpes zoster involving the ophthalmic and maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. After a thorough medical evaluation and required investigations, the patient was put on antiviral therapy, Acyclovir 800 mg orally 5 times daily for 7 days. To combat pain, tramadol 50 mg twice daily was given. At 4 weeks follow-up revealed good improvement in lesions, the lesions of the face and palate showed remission []. Patient reported of reduction in burning sensation, but persistent pain. Patient gave a history of continuous stabbing and burning type of pain with periods of exacerbations and remissions. Patient reported of exacerbation of pain with even a light touch of clothing in the left middle half of the face, a stimulus that does not usually evoke pain (allodynia). The region from the ala of the nose to the lower canthus of the eye and laterally up to the malar region evoked pain on touch indicative of trigger zones.

"A 30 year old male presented at the Surgery OPD with chief complaint of discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for 1 month. The problem started 6 months back when he underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy at another medical college for 3 days old abdominal pain. A small peptic perforation was detected and was repaired with an omental patch. On fourth post-operative day the patient developed burst abdomen. It was managed conservatively. Over a period of time the bowel got contained and the patient was put on oral nutrition. The patient was discharged was doing fine at home. However his abdominal wound was not healing. In the fourth month it was covered with the split thickness skin graft. The procedure and the post-operative period was uneventful till one month. However in the fifth month a serous discharge from the upper part of the grafted surface was noticed. It was coming from a small ulcer and was small in amount. Over a the period of time till he presented at our OPD it remained small in output. It was managed by applying gauge pieces over the wound which has to be changed once or sometimes two to three times a day.\nThe examination of the abdomen revealed a 12 cm × 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft over the middle of the abdomen. There was a small depressed ulcer of around 1 cm × 1 cm in its upper part covered with pale granulation showing serous ooze. Apart from this ulcer there were few other spots showing exuberant pale granulation (). A scar was seen at previous drain site. Palpation of the abdomen showed deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.\nThe blood reports were all but normal. Haemoglobin was 11.4 gm/dl with total WBC count as 11.6 × 103/mm3. The total serum protein was 7.9 gm/dl with serum albumin as 3.5 gm/dl. A left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm × 7 cm was seen on the ultrasound. With a suspicion of some missed pathology at previous surgery site an upper GI endoscopy was performed. A small benign looking ulcer was seen at the pylorus of the stomach.\nWith a strong suspicion of gastrocutaneous fistula, a CT fistulogram was performed. An enterocutaneous fistula between the pylorus of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall was seen. A long side branch of the fistula tract was seen communicating to a moderate sized left subphrenic collection ().\nWith confirmed diagnosis of complex gastrocutaneous fistula a repeat surgery was planned. The abdomen was entered after incising the previous scar on left lateral side and extending the incision downwards and upwards. Dense interbowel adhesions were encountered. Meticulous adhesiolysis and dissection was performed. The abscess cavity was drained and the perforation on the pylorus of the stomach was identified. It was around 1 cm × 1 cm size. Repeat omental patch repair was performed. In view of difficult dissection, feeding jejunostomy and retrograde tube duodenostomy were also made.\nAn uneventful recovery happened. He attended follow up clinic till 4 months following the discharge. There was an incisional hernia but otherwise he was doing fine. After this he was lost to follow up.\nTimeline","{

"A 76 years-old woman with history of controlled hypertension (with losartan and amlodipine) presented to our hospital referring weight loss of 4 kg in two months, edema that progressed to anasarca and back lumbar pain. Besides the edema her physical examination was completely normal with no clinical signs suggestive of hypercortisolism. Among the studies requested, an abdominal tomography showed a right adrenal gland nodule of 14x9 mm and another one in the left adrenal gland of 23x18 mm (), additionally multiple vertebral fractures were reported. As part of the study of adrenal adenomas the patient had an abnormal value of cortisol after a low dose suppression test with dexamethasone (13.3 µg/dL (normal value: <1.8 µg/dL), with a normal value of free urinary cortisol and her potassium was low (she was not on diuretics). The results of the patient laboratory test are shown on .\nWith these results an ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) independent form of hypercortisolism was diagnosed and because the scan of the abdomen had documented the presence of two adenomas, one in each adrenal gland larger than 10 mm, we found ourselves with a therapeutic challenge since the resection of one of the glands may not cure the hypercortisolism in case that the hormonal production came from both glands and the resection of both glands with leave the patient with a permanent hypoadrenalism. It was decided then to perform an adrenal venous sampling to try to determine the origin of the of cortisol production.\nA previously described protocol was used with some changes. The authors of the original protocol propose the measurement of epinephrine as a method to determine the proper location of the catheters when performing the sampling. Because we do not have readily available the measurement of plasma catecholamines the test was performed using radiographic documentation of the tip of the catheter and aldosterone levels were used to make the corrections in the dilution between both sides . Samples of both adrenal veins and inferior cava vein were taken (the procedure is shown in and the results are shown in ). Based on the model of interpretation of adrenal venous sampling proposed by Young the test suggest that the patient has an adrenal hyperplasia with predominance in the production of cortisol from the right side, the results were discussed with the patient and the surgical team and it was then decided to perform a bilateral adrenalectomy. The result of the histological study of the glands was consistent with a bilateral adrenal macronodular hyperplasia.\nThe patient did not have any postoperative complication and received replacement therapy with hydrocortisone 50 mg every 8 h during the first 48 h and subsequently received prednisolone 10 mg and 0.1 mg of fludrocortisone replacement with resolution of the hypokalemia.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Moderate liver function abnormalities', 'History of large goiter'], 'MedicalHistory': {'LiverAbnormalities': 'ALT 3 times normal range', 'LargeGoiter': 'History of large goiter'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Excessive dietary supplement use', 'Type': 'Liver dysfunction', 'Location': 'Liver'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Withdrawal of dietary supplements', 'Details': 'Stopped all supplements except calcium, vitamin D, and one multivitamin a day'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Normal liver function tests', 'DischargeStatus': 'Resolved with withdrawal of offending agents'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Two follow-up visits', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient happy with dietary modifications, declined re-introduction of supplements'}}}"
"A 34-year-old woman who was working as an international migrant worker sustained a crush and degloving injury to the right elbow while operating a waste agitator at an industrial waste management site. On initial examination, the patient was found to have massive skin and soft tissue defects on the anterior aspect of the elbow. The median nerve and brachial artery were exposed and contaminated (). In addition, the proximal part of the entire extensor muscle group was lost, along with segmental loss of the radial nerve with a 6-cm gap. The patient could not extend the right wrist or fingers, and severe muscle weakness (0 or 1 on manual muscle testing) was found in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. The distal area of the right arm showed signs of perfusion, albeit weaker than that in the contralateral arm. The wound was irrigated and debrided, but a bacterial infection was detected after a few days and threatened to obstruct the brachial artery further. The patient was returned to the operating room for additional debridement, a saphenous vein bypass graft to reperfuse the occluded artery and placement of a muscle flap to close the open wound using the distal part of the extensor muscles, which were not salvageable due to the proximal muscle injury and the radial nerve defect.\nThe infection resolved following those surgical procedures. Six months later, the ulnar collateral artery was found to perfuse distally due to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft. Muscle strengths in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves improved to 2 or 3 on the manual muscle test, but there were no signs of recovery in the extensor muscles (). Protective sensation was confirmed in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. Reconstruction of the finger extension with stabilization of the wrist were planned. The tendons of extensor carpi radialis and the tendon of abductor pollicis longus were secured to the radius under 30° of dorsiflexion at the wrist and 10° of radial abduction of the thumb, respectively. The tendon of extensor pollicis longus was transferred to the palmaris longus. Due to insufficient muscle strength, other flexors of the forearm could not be used for tendon transfer. Latissimus dorsi was generally harvested according to the conventional method. To avoid overstretching of the muscle, its resting length was marked by placing sutures in the muscle belly at 5-cm intervals. The origins from the thoracic spinous processes and the thoracolumbar fascia were divided. Caudally, the dissection was continued down to the gluteal fascia across the iliac crest, producing a latissimus dorsi flap that was 50 cm long (). A 14 × 7-cm skin paddle on the muscle belly was applied to the posterior aspect of the upper arm. The fascial end of the flap was introduced subcutaneously to the dorsal forearm, where it was tightly sutured to the tendinous portion of extensor digitorum, with 15° of flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints (MPJ) under 90° of flexion at the elbow (). On the day after surgery, the skin paddle was noted to have a congested appearance, which resolved when the stitches around the skin paddle were unfastened. Neither torsion of the pedicle nor vasospasm was confirmed in visual exploration. Otherwise, the post-operative course was uneventful. The arm was immobilized in a long arm splint with mild shoulder abduction and the elbow flexed at 90° for 4 weeks; during this time and following period, the patient performed thumb and finger exercises with wearing an outrigger splint (). The patient needed to return to her country of origin 3 months after the reconstruction surgery. At the last visit to our institute, natural dorsiflexion of the wrist was maintained, and active thumb and finger flexion was workable (>70° of flexion at the MPJ), where muscle strengths were >3 on the manual muscle test and grip strength rose from 0 preoperatively to 1.2 kgf. These could contribute to improve grasp and several activities of daily living (). Although active muscle contraction was detected in the transferred latissimus dorsi muscle on ultrasound, active finger extension had not yet been confirmed. At 1.5 years after the surgery, the patient answered a questionnaire about the current hand function. She was able to grasp things used in daily life and to extend fingers up as far as approximately 30° of flexion at the MPJ.","{

"A 66-year-old male, with a BMI of approximately 28 kg/m2, presented to our surgery clinic for a symptomatic right lower quadrant trocar site hernia, following robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. In December of 2010 he underwent an uncomplicated robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. At the time of the operation a 12 mm trocar was placed in the right lower quadrant, and it is unclear from the operative note whether the fascia was closed at the conclusion of the operation. He recovered from the surgery without issue but unfortunately developed widely metastatic disease over the next 18 months. Upon presentation to our clinic in May of 2012, he was complaining of a two-week history of right lower quadrant pain and a newly discovered mass in the vicinity of a previous trocar site. He initially noted the onset of the pain when performing pull-ups at a local gym, at which time he noted pulling sensation in the right lower quadrant. Following the initial onset of symptoms, he continued to have pain in the area and noted an intermittent bulge as well. He presented for initial evaluation by his primary care provider who obtained a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The scan revealed a 10 mm right lower quadrant hernia with herniated fat and a tubular structure which was read as a possible omental vessel, with concern for incarceration (). Upon reviewing the CT with the patient in clinic it was felt that the tubular structure was actually the vermiform appendix and thus laparoscopic incisional hernia repair was recommended.\nHe presented the following week for an elective hernia repair. Pneumoperitoneum was established through a 12 mm umbilical Hasson port. Two additional 5 mm ports were then placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the suprapubic area. On inspection of the abdomen there was no evidence of peritoneal disease. The right lower quadrant was then inspected, and as suspected from preoperative imaging a small hernia was identified which contained an incarcerated appendix (). The appendix was reduced from the hernia and during the reduction the mesoappendix was injured so a standard laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. Due to the concern for mesh infection following the appendectomy, the hernia was then closed primarily using 0-Ethibond sutures passed transfascially using a suture-passing device. The patient was discharged home from the recovery room and had no postoperative complications at his 2-week follow-up visit. He has no evidence of hernia recurrence at 12 months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Sudden onset severe headache', 'Generalized tonic and clonic fits', 'Loss of consciousness', 'Neck rigidity', 'Trivial headaches for past 6 years', 'Malaise and low-grade fever for past 6 years', 'Intermittent claudication in bilateral upper limbs'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastEpisodes': 'Similar episodes dating back 1 year', 'TrivialHeadachesHistory': 'Trivial headaches for 6 years', 'IntermittentClaudication': 'In bilateral upper limbs'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT brain', 'Finding': 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension'}, {'Test': 'Cerebral angiography and aortogram', 'Finding': 'Total occlusion of left common carotid artery, 90% occlusion of right common carotid artery'}, {'Test': 'Cerebral angiography and aortogram', 'Finding': 'Saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm'}, {'Test': 'Additional imaging', 'Finding': 'Bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage', 'Type': 'Vascular disorder', 'Location': 'Intracranial circulation'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': '20 mg prednisone', 'Details': 'Reduction of ESR and normalization of C Reactive Protein'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complication with third episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequent expiration'}}}"
"A 65-year-old female was initially admitted with typical angina and impression of acute coronary syndrome in another center. She only had a medical history of hypertension. The electrocardiogram (ECG) had shown 2 mm T inversion in V1-V3 leads, biphasic t waves in I, aVL and QT prolongation (QTc: 0.520 seconds). In the hospital coronary angiography was performed which had revealed two vessel disease. Successful percutaneous coronary intervention was done on left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) in the same session (). The patient was discharged home the next day. She was doing well for about a month till 2 days prior to her second admission when presented with multiple episodes of angina on exertion. She was admitted again. Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits and there were no new ECG changes. Echocardiography showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% without any resting wall motion abnormalities. She still complained of occasional angina pain until she developed a severe resting chest pain associated with nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis at the second day of admission. There was dynamic ECG changed associated with a rise in cardiac biomarkers. The patient was transferred to our center for urgent coronary angiography. In our emergency department, her angina had already decreased to 3 out of a 10 scale pain score. Electrocardiography showed ST depression in V2-V5 leads. The patient was sent to catheterization unit and the problem was observed just before contrast injection. There was a foreign body material stuck in the left main coronary artery which was the tip of a guiding catheter. Coronary angiography showed patent RCA and LAD stents, but there was a significant thrombotic narrowing of distal left main artery with extension of thrombus to the proximal parts of both LAD and left circumflex arteries because of the tip of a guiding catheter lodged in the left main coronary artery ( and ). The patient was sent immediately to the operating room and coronary artery bypass grafting was done successfully. Only two saphenous vein grafts on LAD and main obtuse marginal branches were anastomosed without any attempt to remove the foreign body. The patient was discharged from hospital after 3 days without any further complications.","{

"We report the case of a healthy 19-year old male with no significant past medical or surgical history who injured his right foot his right foot in a road traffic accident and reported to our hospital within two hours of the injury. On examination, there was significant swelling of the foot with a 1.5 cm x 1 cm wound on the plantar aspect through which a bony prominence that appeared to be the head of the first metatarsal was visible. Sensation and vascularity of the foot were normal. Radiographs of the injured foot showed dorsal dislocation of the first and second MTP joints with dorsal displacement of the sesamoid complex ().\nAfter thorough irrigation and debridement of the wound under local anesthesia, reduction was attempted within four hours of the injury using longitudinal traction and dorsally directed pressure over head of metatarsal through the wound and simultaneous plantar directed force on base of proximal phalanx in hyperextension as well as neutral position of the MTP joint, but reduction was not achieved. Patient was then investigated further and in the emergency OT under spinal anesthesia around 12 hours after the injury, reduction was again attempted but failed. The plantar wound (approx 2cm x 1.5 cm in size) which was already located in a nearly transverse direction over the 1st and 2nd metatarsal heads was extended 1.5 cm distally and medially for adequate exposure.\nThe head of the first metatarsal was found to be protruding plantarwards through a rent in the plantar fascia with intact collateral ligaments. The lateral collateral ligament was divided, a lever placed dorsal to the proximal phalanx, longitudinal traction and dorsal push was applied to the head of the metatarsal to achieve reduction of the 1st MTP joint. The sesamoid complex followed the proximal phalanx but the 2nd MTP joint remained unreduced after an attempt at closed reduction. A lever was applied dorsal to the head of 2nd metatarsal along with longitudinal traction through the same wound to facilitate its leverage out of deep transverse metatarsal ligament lying dorsal to its neck to achieve reduction. The reduction of both the MTP joints was assessed for stability after repair of the divided collateral ligament and there was no requirement for fixation with K-wires. (, ).\nThe wound was closed in layers after thorough irrigation and debridement and a bulky dressing with a below knee POP splint was applied. Immediate post-operative radiographs showed proper position and alignment of the joints and sessamoid apparatus. The post-operative dressing was clean and dry and there was no neurovascular deficit. Patient was discharged and followed up for dressings. and was kept nonweight bearing. The wound had healed well, with minimal oedema, and sutures were removed on the 14th postoperative day, and the patient was able to actively plantar flex and dorsiflex the MTP joints.\nThe extremity was placed in a walking cast boot with toe-touch weight bearing aided with a stick for two weeks and then the patient was instructed to bear weight as tolerated on the right foot and advised active and passive range of motion exercises. At one month follow up post-operatively, the patient had good active and passive range of motion and had only mild pain on excessive walking. Thereafter, the patient was evaluated monthly for six months, then three monthly and 12 months and 18 months post-operative follow-up. There was no instance of redislocations or signs of avascular necrosis of the heads of the metatarsals. Range of motion was similar to the contralateral foot and walking was pain free.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaint of facial disfigurement on the left side of the face which gradually progressed over the past 14 years', 'Limited mouth opening'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant past injuries or health issues'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Sclerodermoid tissue reaction suggestive of morphic changes'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Generalized atrophy of the soft tissue of the left hemi face resulting in asymmetry on the left side with deviated nasal septum and marked hypoplasia of the frontal and maxillary sinus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Parry Romberg Syndrome', 'Type': 'Degenerative disorder', 'Location': 'Facial region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Dental and reconstructive plastic surgery using autologous fat transplant'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'To be monitored', 'DischargeStatus': 'Expected good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Expected improvement in facial symmetry and function'}}}"
"A 25-year-old Caucasian female presented to our care with a chronic history of regurgitation of previously ingested food. For the past 4 years, she regurgitated immediately in the postprandial period, occurring within 5 - 25 min after per oral (PO) intake and lasting up to 2 h. These acts of regurgitation were frequently observed by friends and family. When she presented to our care, she was very malnourished and had been maintained on nocturnal jejunal tube feedings. She also complained of multiple bouts of watery diarrhea, amounting to as much as ten episodes per day. Due to the repercussions of her illness, she avoided social gatherings and was not able to maintain her job due to these frequent episodes of regurgitation and subsequent vomiting or swallowing of the food.\nHer past medical problems included asthma and anxiety. Since the beginning of her symptoms 4 years ago she was misdiagnosed multiple times with other gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, she unnecessarily underwent many diagnostic studies and invasive surgical procedures. This downward spiral started when she was being evaluated for right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with persistent episodes of vomiting. She subsequently had an abdominal ultrasound revealing biliary sludge and HIDA scan with an ejection fraction of < 20%. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in March 2010 based on the assumption that her condition was of biliary disease etiology. Her symptoms persisted despite this procedure, and idiopathic gastroparesis was the next assumption on their differentials of postprandial nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis of idiopathic gastroparesis was aided by a delayed GES. A unique finding from this evaluation was that some of the isotope was immediately regurgitated after being ingested. A normal upper endoscopy was also noted at this time. After failing medical therapy for gastroparesis, a gastric stimulator was placed in October of 2010 but with only < 10% improvement of symptoms. As a result, the patient underwent a pyloroplasty in January of 2011. Her symptoms improved for 2 - 3 weeks but then recurred and became associated with watery diarrhea. Her nutritional status deteriorated to the point that she eventually had a jejunostomy tube being placed in August of 2011.\nAfter being referred to several gastroenterologists, she was eventually diagnosed to have rumination syndrome. To aid in the diagnosis, an antroduodenal manometry (ADM) was performed that revealed the characteristic R-waves exhibited in patients with rumination syndrome. The treatment of adult rumination syndrome consists of reassurance, behavior therapy, psychotherapy and relaxation therapies. All of these therapies were attempted and failed to provide a sustained relief of symptoms.\nPhysical examination findings revealed a cachectic female with a body mass index (BMI) of 16. Vital signs that were only significant for hypotension (BP: 80/55 mm Hg). She was in no acute distress with a normal mood, affect, attention span and concentration. Abdomen was soft, not distended, and not tender to palpation. A J-tube was located in the left upper quadrant and a gastric pacing device in the right upper quadrant, with no signs of infection. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. There were no significant laboratory findings on admission.\nThe working diagnosis upon admission was rumination syndrome with conditioned vomiting. Our primary goal was to decrease the frequency of vomiting and diarrhea, which was eventually controlled with medical therapies of loperamide, dicycloamine, nortriptyline and scopolamine for nausea and pain control. Once the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were better controlled, we gradually increased the rate of J-tube feeding to enhance her nutritional status. The general surgery service removed the gastric stimulator and replaced the feeding jejunostomy tube with a Mic-Key button. An upper endoscopy with subsequently done to obtain full thickness gastric biopsies for study of the gastric smooth muscle.\nThe surgical pathology results from the gastric biopsies revealed no evidence of inflammation, necrosis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or malignancy. The nerve bundles and ganglion cells (myenteric plexus) were positive for S100 immunostain and were normal in number. An adequate population of cells of Cajal within the muscularis propria was indicated by positive C-kit staining. Ultimately these findings confirmed that the stomach was functionally normal at the molecular level. The patient was subsequently discharged with outpatient follow-up with a psychologist to put forth a dedicated effort in relaxation and other behavioral techniques.\nAfter 1 year of dedicated attempts of “breathing relaxation techniques”, while being nutritionally maintained by nocturnal jejunostomy feedings, the patient presented again to our care with refractory nausea and vomiting. Her initial vital signs on admission were within normal limits. No significant physical examination findings were noted except she still weighed 90 lbs and had a BMI of 16. No significant abnormalities were noted on the initial laboratory work-up. An upper endoscopy was performed to evaluate the persistent vomiting and hematemesis. But no significant findings were noted except gastric mucosal atrophy. A GES was delayed with > 85% isotope retention. It was apparent that the stomach was anatomically normal but was not functionally normal.\nSurgical intervention was considered as a last resort measure to improve the quality of life of the patient. An extensive psychiatrist evaluation was performed to rule out any psychiatric or eating disorders. The psychiatrist did not establish a diagnosis of anorexia or bulimia nervosa.\nShe underwent a subtotal gastrectomy (80%) with Roux-en-Y reconstruction on the fourth hospital day and the jejunostomy feeding was continued. Pathologic evaluation of the resected stomach revealed chronic gastritis, and the C-kit immunostain showed an average of 11 interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the body of the stomach and 10 ICC in the antrum of the stomach. The jejunostomy tube feeding rate was gradually increased over the hospital course to a goal of 80 cc per hour and she was also tolerating a liquid diet. On subsequent follow-up visits over a 6-month course, the refractory nausea and vomiting had resolved by more than 85% with and improvement in her BMI and quality of life.","{

"The patient was a 47-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who presented to our institution with dysphagia and neck pain after multiple previous cervical spine surgeries at an outside hospital. Her history began with an ACDF from C5 to C7 in 2009 for neck and arm pain. Following her index procedure, she experienced nonunion with loosening of screws and thus underwent a revision extension ACDF from C3 to C7 in 2010 which resulted in significant and immediate neck and arm pain relief. Despite her pain relief, her postoperative course was complicated by superficial surgical site infection necessitating irrigation and debridement 3 days later and antibiotics. Despite no apparent intraoperative complications or oropharyngeal perforation, she experienced significant dysphagia following the third surgery, and, despite unremarkable serial esophagrams, required a feeding tube for approximately 1 year. Gradually, after this period of oropharyngeal rest, her dysphagia somewhat improved and she was able to tolerate a mechanical soft diet with some difficulty. The patient had sustained pain relief but persistent dysphagia for approximately 3 years without any additional work-up. The patient initially presented to our institution following a low-energy fall. Her symptomatology had not changed but routine cervical spine imaging was obtained and she was subsequently referred to our spine specialty clinic for continued evaluation.\nAt the time of her presentation, her plain film radiography () and computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine () revealed nonhealing posterior pseudarthrosis with local kyphosis, screw loosening, plate migration, and air communicating with the plate raising concern for esophageal perforation. In the context of her persistent dysphagia, mild pain, and imaging findings, it was deemed reasonable to proceed with neck exploration in conjunction with our otolaryngology colleagues with plans to remove hardware and then perform staged revision extension of previous fusion from a posterior approach.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and direct laryngoscopy was performed. A pharyngeal defect with exposure of the spinal hardware was noted in the posterior pharynx in the midline (). Further evaluation beyond the proximal esophagus was not attempted for fear of worsening the defect. A nasogastric tube was inserted and attention was turned to the neck dissection.\nThe previous left vertical incision was incorporated into the planned surgical incision, as is customary with revision cervical procedures to protect the contralateral recurrent laryngeal nerve, and a standard anterior approach to the cervical spine was undertaken. The dissection was maintained above the level of the inferior aspect of the thyroid cartilage therefore minimizing risk to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which was monitored with electromyography throughout the case. The cervical plate was found to have eroded through a 2.5 cm posterior pharyngeal wall defect that appeared to be chronic. Reconstruction of the pharynx was performed after plate removal by oversewing the defect with imbricating stitches. The decision was then made to prepare for a staged procedure with posterior spinal fusion (PSF) in the immediate future, but, first, a C3-C4 cervical osteotomy was performed to remove any anterior bony elements and allow deformity correction during definitive fusion. A drain was left in place, and the patient was placed in a halo for temporary cervical spine stabilization.\nTwo days following the initial surgery, the patient was again taken to the operating room and underwent posterior cervical osteotomies and facet resections at C2-C3 and C3-C4 and PSF from C1 to T2 with correction of kyphotic deformity. Her postoperative course consisted of no intake by mouth with nutrition through Dobhoff feeding tube. The halo was left on for a total of 1 month postoperatively and then removed. She remained in a skilled nursing facility for 1 month postoperatively. The patient's pain and dysphagia improved, and there was no evidence of frank contrast extravasation on the immediate or 2-month follow-up swallow study. Flexible fiber optic laryngoscopy at those time intervals also demonstrated an upper airway in continuity without evidence of erosion or abnormalities. The patient's diet was advanced to a mechanical soft diet at 2 months postoperatively, which she tolerated well, and the patient self-advanced her diet to a regular diet approximately 6 months postoperatively with some mild episodic dysphagia. Flexible fiber optic laryngoscopy at 8 months postoperatively demonstrated a well-healed posterior pharyngeal wall all the way to the cricopharyngeus without evidence of exposed cervical spine or cervical spine hardware or any other visual abnormality.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Left sided chest pain radiating to left shoulder', 'Recurrent chest pain with stress or exertion for last few months'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Lipid Profile', 'Finding': 'Elevated cholesterol (238 mg/dl)'}, {'Test': 'Electrocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Premature supraventricular complexes'}, {'Test': 'Cardiac Catheterization', 'Finding': 'Tumor blush with neovascularization from left circumflex artery'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': '6 cm solid and likely necrotic mass near carina extending posterior to left atrium'}, {'Test': 'Transesophageal Echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Large mass extrinsic to heart compressing left atrium'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Cardiac Paraganglioma', 'Type': 'Tumor', 'Location': 'Left atrium'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical resection', 'Details': 'Successful resection by a different surgeon'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Without major complications', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Five years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No tumor recurrence, using thiazide diuretic for blood pressure control'}}}"
"A 26-year-old man presented with melena and underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal CT.\nEndoscopy showed a large submucosal tumor in the gastric body with concomitant bleeding from a large central ulceration containing fluid and residual contrast material from a previous barium study (). Endoscopic ultrasound similarly showed a large submucosal mass (). A first endoscopic biopsy result was non-specific and showed acute and chronic inflammation with ulceration. The second biopsy revealed ulceration and tissue granulation with foreign body giant cells suggestive of a barium granuloma.\nAn abdominal CT scan demonstrated about 5.5 × 3.2 cm sized, well-defined and large exophytically growing mass arising from the posterior aspect of the lesser curvature side in the gastric body. The mass showed a large ulceration at the gastric luminal side and a cavity in the central portion communicating with the gastric lumen. The bulk of the tumor was seen in an extragastric location with extensions into the gastrohepatic ligament and lesser sac. There was no evidence of direct invasion of the adjacent organs or peritoneal spread. No metastatic lesions or lymphadenopathy was seen in the abdomen or pelvis. The mass showed relative hypoattenuation on the precontrast images () and increased heterogeneous enhancement in the portal phase () and prolonged enhancement in the equilibrium phase images (). The radiologic findings were distinct from those of epithelial tumors and the possibility of a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach was considered on CT. The mass was removed under general anesthesia by laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach. During laparotomy there was a round and well demarcated mass arising from the lesser curvature side of the gastric body, and there were prominent vessels around the mass with no detected ascites and no adhesion to the adjacent structures. On gross pathology, the specimen consisted of a portion of the stomach measuring 8.5 × 5 cm with an attached ovoid and lobulated rubbery to firm solid mass measuring 5.4 × 5.2 × 4 cm. The mucosa of the stomach was retracted by underlying the attached mass. Sectioning of the specimen revealed a well demarcated and relatively homogeneously yellow colored mass involving the submucosa and muscular layer ().\nMicroscopic examination indicated that the mass was composed of a patternless proliferation of bland spindle cells with abundant perivascular and intercellular mature collagen formation (). There were few mitotic cells and no nuclear atypia observed in 10 high-power fields, nor any tumor necrosis, suggesting high grade malignant degeneration.\nImmunohistochemistry showed that the neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely positive for CD34 and negative for c-kit (CD117) (), and they were also positive for S-100 and negative for both smooth muscle actin and desmin. Because solitary fibrous tumor rarely develop in the stomach, kit negative GIST was considered as its alternative and PDGFRA gene analysis was performed. However, there was no mutation in the result of PDGFRA gene analysis. Although S-100 positive finding can be seen in neurogenic tumors such as schwannoma, there were no histologic findings suggestive of neurogenic tumor such as nuclear palisading, whorling of the cells and Verocay bodies. Moreover, CD34 test result was positive which are very exceptional in the case of neurogenic tumor, thus greatly diminishing the possibility of neurogenic tumor as its final diagnosis. Conclusively, all these findings are diagnostic for solitary fibrous tumors. The patient's melena resolved following removal of the tumor and the subsequent one year of follow up has revealed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis in this patient.","{

"A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures –). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed layer by layer by using 3/0 resorbable polyglaction for the facia and the subcutaneous layers and 3/0 polypropylene sutures for the skin. After the surgery, pressure bandage was applied for the edema control externally and the patient was ordered soft diet for a week. The postoperative healing was uneventful, and at the sixth month follow-up visit, ideal closure of the fistula was observed (Figures and ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Large, painful swelling in the popliteal fossa of left leg', 'Puncture wound by a nail in left leg 11 years ago with subsequent growth of mass'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Puncture wound by a nail in left leg with subsequent formation of mass'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Doppler ultrasonography', 'Finding': 'Popliteal pseudoaneurysm in distal part of popliteal artery'}, {'Test': 'Arteriography', 'Finding': '4 cm pseudoaneurysm near bifurcation to anterior and posterior tibial arteries'}, {'Test': 'MRI scan', 'Finding': 'Enormous soft tissue mass between medial and lateral heads of gastrocnemius with features of hematoma'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Fibrous pseudocyst of popliteal artery', 'Type': 'Vascular condition', 'Location': 'Popliteal fossa'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Excision of pseudocyst and primary repair to popliteal artery', 'Details': 'Complete resection of pseudocapsule and extended suturing of underlying fascia to prevent recurrence'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No sign of recurrence after one year', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'One year', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Normal neurological examination'}}}"
"A 60-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with a chief complaint of pain and discharge in the upper left back region of the jaw since one and half years. According to the patient one year prior to our consultation, he got the maxillary molars extracted from a local dentist due to pain and mobility of the teeth in that area. Upon consultation patient revealed that the pain continued to exist even after the extraction.\nThe extra oral examination was within normal limits with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. The patient is a known hypertensive and is on medication since three years for the same. The patient had smoking habit, which he quit only a couple of years ago. Intraoral examination revealed a solitary erythematous swelling with diffuse borders involving the left posterior portion of hard palate and was also seen involving the soft palate on the same side. The swelling was seen extending from mesial aspect of first premolar to 1 cm posterior to tuberosity on left side, involving the palatal area but not crossing the midline []. An oro-antral communication was seen with purulent discharge. The remainder of the intraoral examination was within normal limits.\nThe swelling was nontender. The inspectory findings were confirmed on palpation. CT scan revealed complete obliteration of the left maxillary sinus []. The clinical differential diagnosis included a benign or malignant neoplasm of minor salivary glands, a neoplasm of maxillary sinus.\nAn incisional biopsy of palate and sinus lining was performed. Histopathological examination revealed fibrous stroma with areas of hyalinization. Islands of uniform cells arranged in cord-like pattern with hyperchromatic nuclei were seen enclosing round to oval pseudocystic spaces in the stroma. Few of these spaces showed eosinophilic coagulum []. The tumor cells are also seen arranged in the form of solid islands [] and ductal pattern []. The present case showed all the three histological types. There was no evidence of perineural invasion even on serial sectioning. Focal areas showed small cords and longitudinal tubules of isomorphic cells set in a background of densely hyalinized stroma [].\nA diagnosis of ADCC (cribriform pattern) was established. The patient was treated by wide surgical excision with clear margins and hemi-maxillectomy of left maxillary region with post-radiotherapy. The present case was staged as T4N0M0 based on American Joint Committee on cancer as a guide to prognosis. The patient was under regular follow-up and is free of the disease at one-year follow-up.","{

"A 60-year-old Caucasian female patient presented with a painless swelling in the soft palate, breathing and swallowing difficulties, and suffocation feeling. Clinical examination revealed that the lesion was located mostly in the right side, extending from the limit between the hard and soft palate and continuing to the oropharynx. The lesion had smooth surface, hard consistency, and irregular shape (). Cervical tomography was requested (Figures and ). Based on clinical and imaging aspects, a hypothesis of benign X malignant salivary gland tumor was formulated. An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia to establish the definitive diagnosis. However, the histopathological examination of the fragment revealed normal mucosa (). The professionals decided to perform a second conventional biopsy giving attention to collecting material from a greater depth. Once again, the histopathological analysis revealed normal mucosa ().\nThe otorhinolaryngologist team was consulted and the decision was made to perform a CNB. The localization of the lesion was identified during the intraoral exam with no need of imaging guidance (). In CNB a needle is activated by an automatic spring system equipped with outer cannula and inner stylet. Under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine the biopsy area was chosen with palpation of the lump and the tip of the needle was positioned adjacently to the lesion. The handpiece was activated, moving quickly 20 mm back and forth, cutting a sample measuring 17 mm in length. Only one core of tissue was obtained and carefully removed from the biopsy needle. The quality of the specimen was assessed by visual inspection and, with care not to damage the thin tissue, it was put into 10% formalin for fixation. The biopsy site was compressed for five minutes to avoid bleeding and the patient was observed for more 30 minutes and later discharged as no signs or symptoms as bleeding or pain were noted. The histopathological analysis of the sample revealed pleomorphic adenoma (Figures and ).\nThe patient was referred to the head and neck service for complete resection of the tumor. The specimen was sent to the pathology service and the histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis established with CNB (). No complications occurred in the postoperative period and no signs of recurrence were found at the 12-month follow-up ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Unintentional weight loss over 6 months', 'Postprandial abdominal pain and nausea', 'Exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates'], 'MedicalHistory': {'CAD': 'with prior stenting of the left circumflex artery', 'Diabetes': 'with a HbA1c of 5.7', 'SmokingHistory': '80-pack year'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal CT scan', 'Finding': 'Severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery'}, {'Test': 'Mesenteric angiography', 'Finding': 'Demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery and 90% orifice stenosis'}, {'Test': 'Coronary angiography', 'Finding': 'Significant left main and 3-vessel CAD with preserved left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease', 'Type': 'Arterial disease', 'Location': 'Abdominal region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Combined carotid endarterectomy, CABG, and mesenteric bypass', 'Details': 'Left carotid endarterectomy followed by CABG and mesenteric bypass with Vascutek® 12 mm × 6 mm Gelsoft™ graft'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uncomplicated', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged home on post-operative day 7'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '30 and 90 days post-operatively', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No recurrent neurological, cardiac, or mesenteric symptoms'}}}"
"A 67 year old male patient was admitted to the emergency room with dizziness and gait ataxia that had suddenly developed two days previously. The patient was receiving pharmacological treatment for hypertension and diabetes and there was no relevant family history. Other than the dizziness and gait ataxia, the patient complaining of headache, hearing loss and aural pressure in the left ear, and aural discharge but these did not accompany otalgia or tinnitus. The patient displayed a clear state of consciousness in neurological examination, his papillary reflex was normal, and nystagmus was not observed. The patient fell toward left even with his eyes open in the Romberg test and displayed dysmetria on the left side in the cerebellar function finger to nose test. Brain CT taken in the emergency room displayed the formation of a common wall, including the wall that enhanced the contrast in a circle of 5×5 cm toward the left cerebellum and a manifestation in which it pressed the brain stem and the fourth ventricle (). With the suspicion of brain abscess in the left cerebellum, the patient was admitted to the neurosurgical ward and received antibiotic treatment. Two days after he was admitted to hospital, his state of consciousness suddenly altered to drowsy and craniotomy and drainage of abscess was performed in response. As a result of requesting department of otorhinolaryngology for phy-sical examination in order to assess the causative diseases after surgery, it was found that the external auditory canal was narrow and aural discharge and granulation tissue were observed in the left ear. The right ear was normal. Tympanic mem-brane retraction and the aural discharge that accompanies keratin were also observed ().\nOn temporal bone CT taken with the suspicion of left otitis media cholesteatomatica, an overall destruction of the cochlea and vestibular organ in the left ear caused by cholesteatoma was indicated (). Air conduction hearing and bone conduction hearing of 36 dB respectively was presented for the right ear and hearing loss was found in the left ear when performing pure tone audiometry. The degree of paralysis in the left semicircular duct was 100% on the results of a caloric test using air. Under diagnosis of otitis media cholesteatomatica, which causes cerebellar abscess with overall invasion of labyrinth and intracranial expansion, cholesteatoma and granulation tissue were removed through transotic approach (). The surgery was performed a month after performing drainage of the abscess in neurosurgery. As the granulation tissue including keratin had infiltrated the mastoid antrum, auris media, and vestibular labyrinth and had destructed the bone structure, it was difficult to pinpoint the landmark that is seen during tympanomastoidectomy. Although the abscess was discharged within the cochlea, there was invasion into the internal acoustic canal. The junction between the mastoid antrum and posterior fossa was cut after connecting with fibrous tissue and there was no outflow of cerebrospinal fluid. As partial outflow of cerebrospinal fluid was found in the internal acoustic canal, this was stopped with soft tissue and the surgery was finished after filling the deletion by sampling fatty tissue from the stomach. As a result of assessing the bacterial culture from the abscess that was displayed in the mastoid antrum during surgery, group D enterococcus was cultivated and the result for acid-fast bacilli culture was negative. The patient was discharged from the hospital after recovery without neurological sequela and is currently under observation through follow-up CT without relapse ().","{

"A 44-year-old woman was admitted to our outpatient clinic presenting with dysuria and intermittent hematuria for 2 years. She had a medical history of insertion of an IUD inserted 9 years ago. Three months after the insertion of IUD, she fell pregnant unexpectedly. It was her third pregnancy when she was 35 years old and previously she had two children who were 9 and 10 years old at that time. At the visit for pregnancy, the string of the device had not been detected by her gynecologist and it was assumed that IUD had been expelled spontaneously. She had continued her pregnancy and had a normal vaginal delivery without complication. Forty days after delivery, a second IUD had been inserted for contraception. After insertion of the second IUD she had no complaint in the following six years. The second IUD was removed 2 years before her presentation by her gynecologist because of the persistent urinary symptoms which was of newly onset. Physical examination at that time did not show any remarkable finding. Urinalysis was indicative of pyuria and hematuria and urine culture was negative. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an echogenic intravesical lesion measuring about 27 mm with distal acoustic shadow suggestive of a foreign body or calculus. Plain radiography of the pelvis was not informative enough to show details of a foreign body.\nBecause of a lost IUD history and abnormal localized hyperechogenic lesion which was suggestive of a foreign body, we had planned a medical consultation to obstetric and gynecology department. Gynecologic examination reported that there were no visible strings of an IUD and cervix was closed. Transvaginal ultrasonography had revealed that more than half of the echogenic foreign body seemed to be in the bladder and a small part of it in the uterovesical space (). For confirmation and definitive diagnosis, cystoscopic evaluation was performed under local anesthesia and revealed a partially embedded intravesical IUD on the posterior bladder wall, complicated with a stone formation (Figures and ). So the patient underwent endoscopic surgery and the stone around the IUD was crushed using holmium laser lithotripsy. After complete disintegration and extraction of fragmented stones, the IUD was removed through the cystoscope using mechanical forceps (). The operation time was 50 minutes. The urethral catheter was removed and the patient was discharged on the postoperative day. She was followed up for three months. At the first and third month visit, physical examination and urinalysis were normal.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Incidentally found small nodule in lower lobe of right lung', 'Lytic lesion of fifth lumbar vertebral bone'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant past health issues'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Small nodule in lower lobe of right lung and lytic lesion in fifth lumbar vertebral bone'}, {'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance in both lesions'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Transitional Meningioma', 'Type': 'Neoplasm', 'Location': 'Lung and fifth lumbar vertebral bone'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Video-assisted thoracic surgery for pulmonary lesion and curettage of lytic bone lesion', 'Details': 'Resection of lung lesion and curettage of vertebral lesion'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good postoperative progress', 'DischargeStatus': 'Disease-free at 41 months after operation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '105 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Remained disease-free'}}}"
"We present a case of a 42-year-old female who was found to have an incidental renal mass, which, on histological examination of the excised specimen, was revealed to be a clear cell papillary carcinoma, a relatively uncommon variant of renal cell carcinoma. The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented to her local medical officer with a two-week history of neck pain and radicular like pains extending into her right arm. A CT scan of her cervical spine revealed multilevel intervertebral disc and facet joint degenerative change resulting in neural exit foraminal narrowing. She was noted to have raised inflammatory markers (WCC 27.5, neutrophils 24.8, and CRP 319) and S. aureus was isolated on a blood culture. She was commenced on IV antibiotics; however her symptoms failed to improve and she subsequently developed significant lower back pain for which a CT of her lumbar spine was arranged. This revealed no convincing evidence of a lumbar spine infective process; however a 47 × 31 mm solid upper pole mass with an irregular periphery and internal calcification was identified in the left kidney, suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma.\nThe renal mass was further characterized with a triple phase abdominal CT scan and this confirmed a 4 × 4.9 × 4.5 cm heterogenous mass in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of left renal vein involvement nor was any radiologically significant lymphadenopathy seen. Her films were reviewed and the decision was made to biopsy the left renal mass to establish whether the lesion was neoplastic or inflammatory. A core biopsy of the left kidney was reported as a Fuhrman grade 1, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (). She was then booked for an elective laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy. She underwent this procedure without complication and had an uneventful postoperative course subsequently being discharged home on day four.\nMacroscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a tumor in the mid portion of the kidney located superior to the renal hilum measuring 48 mm × 40 mm × 46 mm. The tumour was well circumscribed and bulged anteriorly into but not through the renal capsule. The cut surface was variegated cream, light brown, yellow, and dark brown with no areas of necrosis. Focal calcification was seen. Microscopic examination revealed the tumour to consist of uniform cells with clear cytoplasm and low nuclear grade arranged in tubules with small cysts and papillary structures. A single cell layer was seen in these formations. The component cells showed prominent subnuclear cytoplasmic clearing. There were areas of stromal sclerosis with fresh and old haemorrhage, cholesterol crystals, and haemosiderin laden macrophages. Dystrophic calcification was seen in the areas of sclerotic stroma. There were no psammoma bodies. Bundles of smooth muscle were present in the tumour capsule and within the tumour, in areas surrounding the tubular and acinar structures. The tumor cells were strongly positive for CK7 and CK19 and negative for CD10 and racemase. This pattern of staining is in keeping with a clear cell papillary carcinoma rather than a conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma or papillary cell carcinoma.","{

"A 45-year-old male with end stage renal disease due to chronic glomerulonephritis started automated PD in February 2015 and presented 7 months later with nausea and cloudy PD effluent. The peritoneal effluent white cell count was 996 cells/mL, with a polymorphonuclear cell fraction of 56%. The peritoneal fluid was sent for microbiological investigations and he was given IP vancomycin 2 g and ceftazidime 1.5 g as per the hospital empiric protocol. The culture grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus resistant to beta lactams but sensitive to vancomycin. The IP ceftazidime was discontinued after 2 doses and he continued IP vancomycin every 4 days for a total of 3 weeks. The vancomycin dose was adjusted according to serum vancomycin level and the level remained greater than 25 mg/L throughout the treatment with the highest level being 35 mg/L. His levels were kept deliberately high as he was due for a live donor kidney transplant the following month and the treating team wanted to minimize the risk of relapsed peritonitis.\nOne day after completing the course of vancomycin, the patient presented with general malaise and a skin rash which had begun on the abdomen and progressed to involve the entire trunk and proximal limbs. He reported intense pruritus and pain. He was hypotensive with mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mm Hg, heart rate 115, and temperature T 39.1°C. There was a diffuse blanchable papular rash involving the trunk and proximal limbs without blistering or sloughing. There was no mucous membrane involvement and no lymphadenopathy. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for hypotension requiring vasopressors and was initially treated for possible sepsis with intravenous saline and broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin. Initial laboratory investigations are shown in . All imaging was normal, and blood and urine cultures revealed no growth. After admission day 2 he had a skin biopsy performed which revealed a moderate mixed perivascular infiltrate, composed mostly of lymphocytes with a few neutrophils and scattered eosinophils (). There was a moderate amount of both vacuolar and a slightly lichenoid interface dermatitis, and a few necrotic keratinocytes were seen within the spongiotic epidermis. A few minute foci of parakeratosis were present (). PAS stain was negative for fungal organisms. Biopsy findings were compatible with a drug reaction, and clinically he was felt to meet criteria for drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome). He was given one dose of intravenous solumedrol 80 mg and then switched to oral prednisone 50 g daily for 5 days. He responded well to corticosteroid therapy and was discharged in stable condition after 3 days and received a live donor kidney transplant 7 weeks later.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Incidentally found small nodule in lower lobe of right lung', 'Lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousConditions': 'Usual state of good health', 'FamilyHistory': 'Noncontributory'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Lytic lesion of fifth lumbar vertebral bone and 1.2 cm nodule in lower lobe of right lung'}, {'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Transitional meningioma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Pulmonary nodule and fifth lumbar vertebral bone'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Video-assisted thoracic surgery for pulmonary lesion and curettage of lytic bone lesion', 'Details': 'Resection of 13 mm solid lesion in lung and removal of tumor from fifth left transverse process'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good postoperative progress', 'DischargeStatus': 'Free of disease at 41 months post-operation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '105 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No significant findings other than pulmonary and vertebral lesions'}}}"
"A 70-year-old female was referred to breast re-implantation of the right side due to iatrogenic rupture and explantation during thoracic surgery. The patient had a medical history of cancer in the right breast in 1984 with subsequent treatment including unilateral mastectomy, radiochemotherapy and secondary reconstruction with a subpectoral silicone implant. In 2015 the patient was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma in the right thigh and bilateral pulmonary metastases. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection of the right lung and during this procedure iatrogenic perforation of the silicone implant and injury to the thoracic wall occurred. The thoracic cavity was closed and the perforated breast implant removed without diagnosis of the defect.\nIn stabile condition, the patient expressed a strong desire for breast re-implantation and during this procedure the defect of the thoracic wall and parietal pleura was observed. As the defect was minor, simple closure of soft tissue over the defect would be appropriate in patients not planned for breast reconstruction, however the patient in this case had expressed an extremely strong desire for breast reconstruction. In case of direct closure communication would persist between the lung and the capsular space and therefore it was necessary to close the defect with a thin layer of material allowing both secure closure of the defect and re-implantation. The highly vascularised capsule is known to be appropriate for creation of flaps and grafts, and has previously been used in management of issues in relation to breast implants []. The capsule tissue was an appropriate choice for creation of a pedicled flap in this case because the tissue presented a minimally invasive treatment option for the patient compared to closure with a muscle flap or addition of non-autologus tissue such ADM, increasing infection risk. The anterior part of the capsule in relation to the pectoral muscle was dissected free from the upper pole to the inframammary fold resulting in a medially and centrally vascularised flap. The flap was rotated with the agglutinating side facing downwards to cover the pleural defect and sutured shut. The flap was not expected to be airtight, however placement of the implant directly over the flap ensured necessary pressure to prevent displacement and air leaks. Pressure ventilation found the new capsular patch airtight. Next pleuracentesis was performed in order to control the pneumothorax and finally the flap was sutured in place to close the defect before placement of the silicone implant. Preventative iv. antibiotics were administered. Postoperatively the patient had discrete air effusion once the chest tube suction was discontinued and after five days chest x-ray showed a 5,2 cm apical lung pneumothorax. The patient had no pulmonary symptoms. At the one-week follow-up a regression of the pneumothorax from 5,2 cm to 3,1 cm was found and at the twelve month follow up the reconstruction was fully functioning and the patient asymptomatic.","{

"This is a healthy appearing 77 year old man with bladder cancer. He presented in April 2016 with an episode of gross hematuria. He lives in Central America and was seen by a urologist there.\nHis past medical history is uneventful. He has adult onset type 2 diabetes and takes metformin. He was never a cigarette smoker. The only surgery he had was a right inguinal hernia repair. He is not overweight.\nIn April 2016 he had two papillary tumors which appeared to be Ta. He underwent a transurethral resection and the pathology was low grade Ta. His first surveillance cystoscopy was negative. In October 2016 he had four LG Ta tumors which were resected. This was followed by 6 weeks of intravesical chemotherapy using mitomycin C.\nThe patient was tumor free until August 2018 at which time he was found to have multifocal bladder cancer. A transurethral resection revealed high grade Ta urothelial cancer. There was also focal carcinoma in situ. Lamina propria and muscularis propria were present and were free of cancer. He received one dose of intravesical MMC postoperatively. He elected to have a consultation here in South Florida.\nHe presented with nocturia×4 and some daytime frequency. Prior to the recent TUR BT he had nocturia×2 and no daytime voiding complaints.\nI saw the patient in September 2018. I reviewed the recent bladder tissue (–) and proceeded with office flexible cystoscopy. The bladder had several areas of necrosis consistent with MMC effect on the previous resected urothelium (). In addition there were areas of persistent or new tumor which appeared to be high grade Ta ().\nThere are two quite different alternatives in my view. One might proceed with a TUR BT and remove all visible tumor. If the pathology is, as expected, high grade Ta with or without CIS one might proceed with a bladder preservation approach which would consist of a course of intravesical BCG. This might be reasonable as he has not had a bladder cancer which invaded the lamina propria or muscularis propria. Given his voiding symptoms there would be some question as to whether he could tolerate BCG.\nAlthough it is unusual to consider a radical cystoprostatectomy for someone who has yet to have an invasive bladder cancer this man has an unusual course. Relatively few patients with initial LG Ta BC progress in grade and even fewer progress in stage, i.e. T1 or T2. Although this man has not progressed in stage the dramatic change in grade and extent of urothelial involvement has been striking. The extensive urothelial alteration by the MMC has led to bothersome voiding complaints and this is unlikely to relent while proceeding with another TUR BT and BCG.\nThis man has a negative CT scan and no evidence of other pathology.\nWhat would you suggest? If you suggest a cystectomy would you favor an ileal conduit given his age or offer him a neobladder if he would prefer to avoid a stoma.\nWe invite our readers to review and comment on the case and management by using the online comment section below the case:","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Morning stiffness and pain on the medial side of the right knee', 'Difficulties with full flexion of the right knee', 'Bilateral painless swollen calf muscle'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'No bony irregularities in the tibia'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Venous malformations', 'Type': 'Asymptomatic', 'Location': 'Soleus muscle'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative management', 'Details': 'Focused on osteoarthritis of the knee with good result'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Asymptomatic calf muscles at three months follow-up'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No disabilities in daily living'}}}"
"A 38-year-old Indian male was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic, Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine for the evaluation and management of progressive trismus. Patient presented with main complaint of inability to chew food and limited mouth opening. He reported that this has been going on with him for the last few years but became more concern for him just recently. His medical history was significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia which all are controlled by medications. Patient reported that he has been chewing pan of Indian tobacco for the last 15 years. Clinical exam showed no lymphadenopathy, swelling, or asymmetry. Limited mouth opening at 15 mm and cranial nerves exam is unremarkable except for alter sensation in the buccal branch of V 3 bilaterally (). Intraoral exam showed poor oral hygiene, multiple carious teeth. Palpable severe fibrous bands in buccal mucosa from just inside the commeasure of the mouth up to the pterygomandibular raphe were felt bilaterally. Soft palate, tongue and floor of mouth were not involved. The fibrosis has resulted in pale-appearing mucosa. An incisional biopsy was taken for histopathological evaluation which confirmed the diagnosis of submucous fibrosis infiltrating the muscular layer (), after discussion of the clinical findings and treatment options with the patient. The patient was taken to the operating room where he was placed on the surgical table hooked to the anesthesia, cardiac monitors, and pulse oximeter. Next patient was induced via intravenous general anesthesia and intubated with no complications. Local anesthesia was infiltrated in the intended surgical areas. Using a transoral approach a blade number 15 was utilized for the surgical excision of the fibrous bands and protecting underlying vital structures. Surgical dissection was carried out to the level of the buccinator muscle. After controlling bleeding the wound edges were prepared for the graft placement. Next attention was made toward the right thigh from which a 7 × 7 cm full thickness skin graft was harvested (); using sharp dissection, was done to the level of the subcutaneous fat. Electrocautery was use to ensure homeostasis and appropriate pressure was placed on the donor site. After that the graft was cut to custom fit each defect and multiple perforations were done throughout the graft to ensure rapid revascularization and prevent hematomas from developing. Next the grafts were sutured into place using 3′0 Chromic Gut restorable sutures in simple interrupted fashion (). Mouth opening was measured toward the end of the procedure and was recorded at 32 mm. After that the surgical area was irrigated and patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. Postoperatively the patient was placed on full liquid diet for two weeks and one week supply of Motrin 400 mg, Percocet 5/325 mg, Keflex 250 mg, Medrol dose pack. Patient was followed regularly and on the second week his mouth opening was noted to decrease to 25 mm at which a course of total of 80 mg of Triamcinolone intramuscular injections were done with 40 mg in each side. Patient was placed on vigorous mouth opening exercises using Therabite devise. Patient responded well to the treatment regimen and maintained mouth opening at 30 mm after 12 months of treatment with good ability to have a satisfactory masticatory function ().","{

"A 75-year-old female patient reported to our maxillofacial surgical services with the chief complaint of intra-oral painless growth since one and half year. She also had a complaint of difficulty in closing the mouth since past 2-3 months.\nThe patient was relatively asymptomatic one and half year back, then the patient started noticing small painless growth inside the oral cavity in the right mandibular alveolar region, and growth gradually started increasing in size. Few months later she also started having fetid odor from the oral cavity. Because of large size of the growth the patient started having difficult in closing the mouth completely and inability to chew the food. The patient had a history of exfoliation of mandibular teeth and few maxillary teeth due to extensive mobility. During the dental education camp held in patient's village, the patient turned up for consultation. The patient was then referred to outpatient department of maxillofacial surgery at Sardar Patel Institute of Dental and Medical Sciences, Lucknow. Past history and medical history did not reveal any relevant information. She was taking no medication and had no history of known drug allergy. Her general physical examination revealed no abnormality other than those related to the chief complaint except for moderate visual and hearing impairment.\nOn examination growth was slightly visible when the patient protruded the tongue. The patient was unable to close the mouth completely due to size of the lesion []. On intra-oral examination smooth surfaced, and lobulated growth of approximately 5 × 4 × 2 cm in size was present covering the alveolar ridge from the midline to molar region on completely edentulous alveolar ridge. Growth was pedunculated and was freely movable over peduncle which was present on the alveolar ridge of the premolar region. Surface of growth was smooth and showing normal color in certain areas whereas superior surface of the growth in certain area was covered by yellowish plaque like material. Growth was partially divided into two large lobules covering both buccal and lingual vestibules []. Mild indentation of maxillary teeth was observed on the superior surface of the growth. On palpation, growth was nontender, nonfluctuant, hard and fibrous in consistency without tendency for excessive bleeding upon probing under topical anesthesia. While the mandibular ridge was completely edentulous, the maxillary arch showed the presence of supra eruption of maxillary teeth from first molar to first molar on both sides. All maxillary teeth were periodontally compromised and showed grade 3 mobility. Tongue movements were unrestricted. There was no evidence of submandibular lymphadenopathy or paresthesia/anesthesia in the region of inferior alveolar nerve.\nProvisional diagnosis of benign irritational hyperplasia/fibroma was made. Supra-eruption and the presence of sharp edges of maxillary teeth were considered responsible for providing low grade chronic irritation required for development o growths.\nOn radiographical examination of the mandibular ridge a moderate resorption of the alveolar ridge was observed which was biconcave in shape, which might be suggestive resorption due to pressure from the growing lesion. The presence of small root piece of about 3–4 mm was seen in the right mandibular posterior region [].\nSince the lesion was though unusual in size but having pedunculated base, treatment plan comprising of excisional biopsy of the growth and total teeth extraction was formulated and explained to the patient and her relatives and written and informed consent was procured. Routine hematological examination was advised and values were found to be within normal limits. An excisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia [xylocaine 2% with adrenaline 1:200000]. After securing local anesthesia, growth was gently lifted to make the peduncle visible from both buccal and lingual. A sharp bone touching elliptical incision was made around the peduncle and on the alveolar ridge. With the help of periosteal elevator it was lifted along with the underlying periosteum from the bone surface and removed. Hemostasis was achieved and single layer closure was performed with the help of 3–0 silk suture. Excised specimen was preserved and sent to Dept. of oral and maxillofacial pathology for histopathological examination which confirmed it as Pyogenic granuloma [Figures and ]. The patient revisited after 7 days for suture removal []. The patient is currently under follow up without any signs of the recurrence of a lesion. The time of the total follow up till date is 1 year.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Wound dehiscence on left knee with hardware exposure', 'Progressive pain in left hip, particularly when walking'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Total left hip arthroplasty at age 74 due to severe osteoarthritis'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of femoral component'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation)'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Infection leading to wound dehiscence', 'Type': 'Post-surgical complication', 'Location': 'Left knee with hardware exposure'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Retention debridement and wound coverage with flap', 'Details': 'Initial attempt with lateral gastrocnemius flap, followed by latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with AV loop'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Stable condition, wound healing properly, started rehabilitation', 'DischargeStatus': 'Enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation program'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing monitoring', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Able to ambulate without assistance, no signs of infection recurrence'}}}"
"A 6-month-old baby boy presented at the Vascular Surgery clinic with a 2-month history of swelling noticed by his parents on the hypothenar eminence of the left hand (). The swelling was gradually increasing in size. The parents gave no history of any unusual crying of the baby, which concludes that it was painless. On our examination, the swelling was around 4×2 cm in size. It was pulsatile on palpation, and there were no motor deficits in the left hand. This swelling was localized in the left hand hypothenar eminence, and both the radial and ulnar pulses were palpable with a good capillary refill. On taking a detailed history, the mother explained that the baby had the habit of hitting his left hand mainly on the table while having food and on other objects. With the clinical history and examination, an aneurysmal swelling was confirmed, most likely arising from the ulnar artery or the palmar arch because of its location. He came in with an arterial duplex, which confirmed only an aneurysmal sac. There was no detailed anatomical description because of the compromised examination due to the age of the child. No other investigations were carried out to confirm the diagnosis because of financial limitations and the very young age of the child, and we opted for surgical excision directly. Intraoperatively, it was an aneurysmal swelling involving the ulnar artery from below the wrist and at the distal forearm involving the superficial palmar arch distally and taking the digital blood supply of the little finger and the ring finger with it (). This aneurysm was excised and repaired with an interposition reverse cephalic vein graft from the forearm of the same side (). A segment of the Y-shaped cephalic vein with a tributary was taken from the distal forearm of the same side. The proximal end of the reverse cephalic vein was anastomosed to the distal end of the ulnar artery, and the two distal ends of the reverse cephalic vein in a Y-shape fashion were anastomosed, one at the superficial palmar arch and one at the common digital artery of the fourth and fifth fingers at the fourth web space. The histopathology of the aneurysmal sac confirmed a dilated vascular channel with fibrin and an attenuated intima, compatible with an aneurysm with no signs of vasculitis. Postoperatively, he had palpable pulses in both the ulnar and radial arteries, and his motor movement was intact. He was not kept on any anticoagulation, and no further follow-up studies were conducted.","{

"A 10 year old male patient presented with a severe head trauma after falling from a roof that required an immediate decompressive craniotomy (Fig. ). The patient was hospitalized in the ICU for 8 days, after which the cerebral oedema resolved, and he was then discharged. Three months later, he was referred to the Plastic Surgery Department by the Department of Neurosurgery to plan the patient’s treatment and his cranial reconstruction. He was assessed by our department and was found to be alert and oriented, calm, and cooperative. A CT revealed a 12 cm by 12 cm defect (Fig. ). The prosthesis was fashioned and the patient was operated 10 days later (Fig. ). The thickness of the implant produced for this case was of 5 mm. The thickness of the prosthesis matches the patient’s cranial vault thickness. The patient was discharged from the hospital 2 days after surgery, he immediately started a physical therapy program and he returned to school after 2 months of therapy without sequelae or neurologic damage. The patient said that his headache subsided, since the prosthesis relieves atmospheric pressure on brain tissue.\nA 17 year old male patient presented after a motorcycle accident where he was not wearing a helmet. Upon his arrival at the hospital with a diagnosis of TBI (traumatic brain injury), he was evaluated by the Department of Neurosurgery who decided to treat the patient with a decompressive craniotomy. A CT was done to complete the diagnosis and plan the surgery. The patient had a bifrontal 20 cm cranial defect from the temporal fossa of one side to the other and 10 cm vertical distance (Fig. ). The thickness of the implant in this case was of 6 mm. It is 1 mm thicker than that of the previous case due to patient anatomic differences in diploe thickness. After surgery, he remained hospitalized for 2 weeks before discharging him. He was referred to us after 3 months of physical therapy once the Neurosurgical Department considered cranial reconstruction feasible. The patient was evaluated and was found to have no neurologic damage and an intact scalp. The patient was deemed an excellent candidate for the placement of a 3D PMMA pre-operative manufactured cranial prosthesis, 2 days after which the patient had a good evolution and was discharged. After 2 months, the patient returned to his normal school activities.\nIn Mexico these procedures have to be payed in full by the patient, limiting their reach and practice in the general population since they are costly. A customized titanium implant costs around US$5000, and those made from PEEK around US$7000 or more depending on their size. The customized prostheses proposed by the authors have a cost of about US$600, including the digital design, printing of a 3D prototype and the PMMA prosthesis itself. Both titanium and PMMA are the most commonly used alloplastic materials [, ].\nThe CT scan data is stored in the standard format DICOM (Digital Images and Communications in Medicine) which allows generating an interface between the medical equipment and any other device to visualize the images. Through the DICOM viewer, Osirix® generated a three-dimensional reconstruction of all the CT cross-sectional images. A bone filter is applied in order to only observe the bone structure, achieved by taking as reference its attenuation degree.\nThe implant is generated using the software of the computer-aided design (CAD) ZBrush 4R5® since Osirix® is only a viewer.\nThe implant piece, Vimplant, is generated from the CT skeletal reconstruction of the patient’s cranium. With volumetric reconstruction, Vtotal, and considering its symmetry; an imaginary division is made on the sagittal plane, obtaining two volumes, Vleft and Vright. A boolean operation is applied to the volumes Vleft and Vright: Vimplant = Vleft - Vright (Fig. ).\nThe implant design must have a precise shape and volume according to each patient’s cranial anatomy. Finally, the data is exported in a stereolithography extension file (STL) and fed to the printer.\nA CUBE 3D (from 3D System) printer is used to print out a PLA prosthesis from the STL file using a fused deposition model by means of a 1,75 mm filament at a 260 °C extruder temperature (Fig. ). Once the printing process is finished, which takes about 20 h, the scaffolds are removed with a low-speed motor and a carbide bur and the adjustment is verified (Fig. ). The prosthesis is then taken to the dental laboratory.\nThe prosthesis is placed in metal containers to obtain two plaster impressions (an internal and an external surface impression). A transparent PMMA OPTI-CRYLR is poured into the space created by the internal plaster impression and pressed with the external mold. The casts are opened and the prosthesis is revealed after a 25-min polymerization time (Fig. ). The prosthesis is then cut, perforated, and polished with a low-speed motor. Precise anatomical compliance to the model is verified and approved by the multi-disciplinary team (including the neurosurgeons), and the prosthesis is then placed on a mannequin for academic and illustrative purposes (Fig. ). After obtaining the prosthesis in the laboratory, it is washed with normal saline solution and then submerged in a chlorine based antiseptic solution (Microdacyn 60 by Oculus lnnovative Sciences in Petaluma, CA.) for 15 min before taking it to the hospital where it is sterilized with ethylene oxide gas before its implantation (Fig. ).\nCranioplasties were carried out 3 months after craniotomy in conjunction with the neurosurgeons. The prostheses were then placed over each of the defects to adjust them in vivo with minimum adjustments with the same low-speed electric motor, and fixed with 3 long titanium bridge plates, each held down with 2 screws (Fig. ). The procedure ended without any unexpected events. The patients were hospitalized for 2 days and discharged after a single drain is removed from each patient to continue their care as outpatients (Fig. ).\nThe patients were evaluated every week for 6 months to register PMMA behaviour, biological sefety and any eventualities (Fig. ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Incidentally found small nodule in right lung and lytic lesion in fifth lumbar vertebra'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Lytic lesion of fifth lumbar vertebral bone and 1.2 cm nodule in right lung'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Transitional meningioma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Right lung and fifth lumbar vertebral bone'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Video-assisted thoracic surgery for pulmonary lesion and curettage of vertebral lesion', 'Details': 'Resection of 13 mm solid lesion in lung and curettage of lytic bone lesion'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good progress', 'DischargeStatus': 'Free of disease at 41 months after operation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '105 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No significant findings other than pulmonary and vertebral lesions'}}}"
"A 30 year old male presented at the Surgery OPD with chief complaint of discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for 1 month. The problem started 6 months back when he underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy at another medical college for 3 days old abdominal pain. A small peptic perforation was detected and was repaired with an omental patch. On fourth post-operative day the patient developed burst abdomen. It was managed conservatively. Over a period of time the bowel got contained and the patient was put on oral nutrition. The patient was discharged was doing fine at home. However his abdominal wound was not healing. In the fourth month it was covered with the split thickness skin graft. The procedure and the post-operative period was uneventful till one month. However in the fifth month a serous discharge from the upper part of the grafted surface was noticed. It was coming from a small ulcer and was small in amount. Over a the period of time till he presented at our OPD it remained small in output. It was managed by applying gauge pieces over the wound which has to be changed once or sometimes two to three times a day.\nThe examination of the abdomen revealed a 12 cm × 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft over the middle of the abdomen. There was a small depressed ulcer of around 1 cm × 1 cm in its upper part covered with pale granulation showing serous ooze. Apart from this ulcer there were few other spots showing exuberant pale granulation (). A scar was seen at previous drain site. Palpation of the abdomen showed deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.\nThe blood reports were all but normal. Haemoglobin was 11.4 gm/dl with total WBC count as 11.6 × 103/mm3. The total serum protein was 7.9 gm/dl with serum albumin as 3.5 gm/dl. A left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm × 7 cm was seen on the ultrasound. With a suspicion of some missed pathology at previous surgery site an upper GI endoscopy was performed. A small benign looking ulcer was seen at the pylorus of the stomach.\nWith a strong suspicion of gastrocutaneous fistula, a CT fistulogram was performed. An enterocutaneous fistula between the pylorus of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall was seen. A long side branch of the fistula tract was seen communicating to a moderate sized left subphrenic collection ().\nWith confirmed diagnosis of complex gastrocutaneous fistula a repeat surgery was planned. The abdomen was entered after incising the previous scar on left lateral side and extending the incision downwards and upwards. Dense interbowel adhesions were encountered. Meticulous adhesiolysis and dissection was performed. The abscess cavity was drained and the perforation on the pylorus of the stomach was identified. It was around 1 cm × 1 cm size. Repeat omental patch repair was performed. In view of difficult dissection, feeding jejunostomy and retrograde tube duodenostomy were also made.\nAn uneventful recovery happened. He attended follow up clinic till 4 months following the discharge. There was an incisional hernia but otherwise he was doing fine. After this he was lost to follow up.\nTimeline","{

"A 46-year-old man with diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department at our hospital with symptoms of right foot pain and fever. The patient developed ASO in the right lower extremity as a complication of diabetes. Arterial occlusion started from 10 cm distal to the knee joint and involved the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery, and peroneal artery. The patient had already had right second and third metatarsophalangeal joint disarticulations in the plastic surgery department of our hospital. Nevertheless, infection and necrosis in the right foot progressed rapidly and worsened to a condition requiring additional surgery (). However, because a tibial IM nail had been inserted into the ipsilateral limb, the patient was referred to the orthopedic surgery department.\nAbove-knee and through-knee amputations were also considered surgical options for the patient. However, it was determined that the blood flow to the distal part of the popliteal artery was intact. Also, infection and necrosis had not progressed beyond the foot. The skin color of the right calf seemed healthy on physical examination. Therefore, we decided to remove the tibial IM nail and perform a below-knee amputation. However, performing additional surgery around the knee joint to remove the tibial IM nail was thought to have a high possibility of complications. Thus, surgery was planned to remove the amputated limb and IM nail at the same time by performing an amputation with the nail fixed on the ankle by distal locking screws.\nThe tibial bone cutting level was determined by referring to the lateral view of the tibial plain radiograph. The tibial IM nail is designed to have an anterior angulation in the proximal part. Therefore, if tibial bone cutting is performed distal to the angulation of the nail, the nail may not be removed from the proximal part of the tibia due to the angulation of the nail. Therefore, we decided to perform tibial bone cutting at the point of the anterior angulation in the nail to leave as much of the tibia as possible (). In this patient, the anterior angulation of the tibial nail was about 10 cm away from the tibial plateau on the X-ray, so tibial bone cutting was performed 10 cm away from the tibial plateau.\nThe patient was positioned in a supine position on the operating table. A nonsterile tourniquet was applied to the upper thigh for use in case of major bleeding, and surgery was initiated without inflation of the tourniquet under general anesthesia. Most of the surgery was performed similarly to the typical transtibial amputation procedure, and a long posterior flap was used. The skin incision was designed for a long posterior flap, and an incision was made in the skin and fascia. The anterior and lateral compartment muscles were divided. During dissection, the anterior tibial artery and vein were ligated. The fibula and tibia were exposed, and the proximal interlocking screw of the tibial nail was removed. Among the proximal interlocking screws, the screw located at the distal part was removed from the exposed tibia without an additional incision. The remaining proximal interlocking screw was removed by making a minimal incision of about 7 mm in the previous surgical scar. Next, tibial cutting was performed. Using a ruler, a site about 10 cm away from the tibial plateau was measured and marked on the tibia, and the tibia was cut using an oscillating saw, except the IM nail. A sagittal cutting blade was used for the blade of the oscillating saw. However, the posterior surface of the tibia was cut using a reciprocating blade while protecting the deep posterior compartment with Adson tissue forceps. The fibula was cut 1 cm proximal to the tibia using an oscillating saw and bone cutter. The posterior flap was made by completely separating the posterior musculature from the tibia and fibula. At this point, the amputated limb and lower extremity were connected only by the IM nail inserted into the tibia. Insert an osteotome into the tibial osteotomy gap with a mallet to expand the gap. If the opening of the osteotomy seems insufficient, use 2 or 3 stacked osteotomes or thicker osteotome until the osteotomy is opened to the desired extent. After widening the gap to about 2-3 mm, gentle traction and a twisting force were applied several times on the amputated limb. Then, the amputated limb was separated from the proximal tibia with the IM nail connected (). The anterior lip of the tibia was beveled. The tibial, peroneal, and sural nerves were sharply divided and allowed to retract to prevent neuroma formation. The bulky soft tissue of the posterior flap was trimmed to create a properly shaped posterior flap. After irrigation and drainage insertion, the deep fascia and skin were sutured without tension (). No hardware remained after surgery ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Incidental finding of small nodule in lower lobe of right lung during regular checkup', 'Results of laboratory studies within normal limits, negative family history'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Lytic lesion in fifth lumbar vertebral bone and small nodule in lower lobe of right lung'}, {'Test': 'MR imaging', 'Finding': 'Increased size of pulmonary nodule and vertebral lesion'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Transitional meningioma', 'Type': 'Spindle cell neoplasm', 'Location': 'Lower lobe of right lung and fifth lumbar vertebral bone'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Video-assisted thoracic surgery for pulmonary lesion and curettage of lytic bone lesion', 'Details': 'Resection of well-circumscribed solid lesion in lung with fascicular architecture of spindle or polygonal cells'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good postoperative progress', 'DischargeStatus': 'Free of disease at 41 months after operation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '105 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No significant findings other than pulmonary and vertebral lesions, patient remained disease free'}}}"
"A 79 year old man presented with a discharging sinus in the epigastrium.

His postoperative recovery following his second valve replacement was uneventful. He continued to be well and asymptomatic with a well healed sternal wound for the next 12 years. However, 12 years following his 2nd operation, he presented with a discharging sinus in epigastrium (fig ) which was initially treated with dressings and antibiotics by his GP. Exploration of the sinus under general anaesthetic was undertaken after the sinus failed to heal. The sinus was in communication with anterior mediastinum by penetrating the rectus sheath and was divided at the point of entry into mediastinum and removed. All sternal wires were removed. Microbiology of the excised tissue revealed staphylococcus aureus infection and this was treated with appropriate antibiotics for 4 weeks. However, the wound failed to heal although he never developed any signs of systemic illness. A CT scan of chest showed an encapsulated mass extending from ascending aorta to the diaphragm and normal sternum. Transthoracic echocardiography ruled out pseudoaneurysm of ascending aorta, prosthetic endocarditis or aortic root abscess. An MR scan confirmed a longitudinal retrosternal mass extending from mid ascending aorta to the diaphragm (figs and ) and cutaneous fistulization to the epigastrium through left rectus sheath.\nAn exploratory secondary median sternotomy was made with cardiopulmonary bypass on standby. Heart and the great vessels were dissected out within the pericardial cavity. A nonpulsatile longitudinal 15 cm mass was found on the anterior surface of ascending aorta and right ventricle along the entire length of anterior mediastinum. At the level of the diaphragm, the mass exited the mediastinum by penetrating the left rectus sheath and communicated with the skin in the epigastrium. At the junction of the superior 1/3 and inferior 2/3, there was a branching tract extending from the main tract to the right and inferiorly over right atrium and the hilum of right lung. The upper part of the mass was aspirated with a wide bore needle when thick cheesy material came out (fig ). The entire mass and the branching tract were laid open (fig ), only the middle 2 inches of the mass over the right ventricle having no lumen. The superior half of the tract that lay open was, interestingly, filled with old suture material and Teflon pledgets in addition to thick cheesy material mentioned before. The inferior part of the tract, that had fistulized through the rectus sheath to the epigastric skin, was filled with yellow fresh pus and a piece of old temporary pacing wire. Both the white cheesy material and the pus were sent separately for bacteriological analysis and both grew staphylococcus aureus. The upper mass was almost completely excised except for a thin rim posteriorly which was densely adherent to aorta and the adjacent right atrium and right ventricle. The lower mass was completely excised along with the contiguous portions of rectus muscle, xiphoid, subcutaneous tissue, the sinus and the core of the epigastric skin. Through the same incision, the diaphragm and peritoneum were opened. The greater omentum, based on the right gastroepiploic pedicle, was freed from the greater curvature of the stomach, divided to the far left of the stomach and transposed into the chest to cover the entire raw area of the excised mass and sinus and secured in place with stitches (fig ). Patient received intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks and was discharge home thereafter, his sternal wound having healed satisfactorily. At follow up 2 years later, he remains fit and well.","{

"The patient, a 36-year-old woman with a known case of exstrophy of the bladder had undergone repair of the defect 17 years previously. However, dehiscence of the repair had occurred and the patient continued to leak urine from the lower abdominal wall. Six months following this, an ileal conduit urinary diversion was done to prevent the continuous leakage of urine. Six month prior to presentation, the patient had noticed an irregular mass arising from the exposed bladder mucosa that was rapidly increasing in size. On examination, a hemispherical growth with an irregular surface was seen in the region of the exposed bladder mucosa (). The computed tomography scan showed a mildly enhancing nodular lesion on the right side of the lower abdomen superficially. The lesion was confined to the urinary bladder. A wedge biopsy was taken from the growth, and the results were suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma. The results of a routine hematological evaluation, liver function tests, and a chest radiograph were normal. The patient thus underwent removal of the urinary bladder along with a cuff of the surrounding abdominal wall and pelvic lymph node dissection (radical cystectomy). After resection, there was a full thickness defect of the lower abdomen about 8 cm×9 cm in size. To cover this defect, the peritoneum was mobilized on both sides and was sutured in the midline. Both recti were also mobilized and sutured in the midline. The skin defect was resurfaced with an extended groin flap from the left side and the secondary defect thus created was covered by a split thickness skin graft (, ). Histopathological examination of the resected specimen was suggestive of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the underlying muscle (stage pT2a) with dense lymphocytic infiltration of the stroma. All the resected margins and deeper plane of resection were free of tumor (). In the postoperative period, the patient developed a small collection beneath the flap that was drained by removal of two stitches, and daily dressings were done. This site granulated well and healed without any significant additional scaring. The patient is on regular follow-up and is doing well without any evidence of recurrence to date (5 months postoperatively) ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Vague headache since being tackled during exercise', 'Aggravated headache and generalized partial seizure'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Initial brain CT revealed subdural hematoma and calcified nodules at left frontotemporal cortex'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Brain CT', 'Finding': 'Small subdural hematoma on left cerebral convexity and calcified nodules at left frontotemporal cortex'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Increased hematoma size, cerebral edema, small enhancing mass at left cerebral convexity'}, {'Test': 'MRA', 'Finding': '4mm aneurysmal dilatation of cortical branch of MCA'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Subdural hematoma with pseudoaneurysm of cortical MCA branch', 'Type': 'Traumatic hemorrhage with aneurysmal dilatation', 'Location': 'Left cerebral convexity'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Emergency craniotomy for aneurysm removal and hematoma evacuation', 'Details': 'Large craniotomy, meticulous dissection and removal of hematoma, excision of aneurysm and calcified nodules'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Without sequelae', 'DischargeStatus': 'After short hospital stay'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Not specified', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No sequelae, patient recovered well'}}}"
"A 35-year-old educated young male is the main caregiver of his mother, who is a cancer survivor. He has two children of 3 years and 6 years old. He is the sole earning member of his family. The journey of his life has been filled with many challenges for the past 10 years.\nHis first complex caregiving episode dates back to the time when he was 25 years old. He had just started a new job after completing his education. However unfortunately, at the same time, his mother was diagnosed with colon carcinoma. He recalled that it seemed to him as the end of the world at that time. It was for the first time in his life that he experienced a sense of great responsibility toward his mother. He assumed the role of a parent for her and followed her up for treatments in the hospital, caring for her at home after surgery and supporting her emotionally as well. As his father was not educated and sister too young to understand, he did not share much of his loneliness and distress with anyone. After the surgery slowly over a period of a year, his mother's health improved, which relieved his distress.\nThe second complex caregiving episode was when his father died due to a sudden cardiac event (massive heart attack) 4 years back. This was a major turning point in his life. He felt all alone. He hardly used to discuss all his fears with his father, but still, he felt that his father was the only source of social and emotional support for him. Furthermore, seeing the mother in grief and fearing the ill effects of stress on her health. He now realized that he has to be the support system for his whole family. With responsibility came more stress, which further strained him emotionally.\nHe describes the present complex caregiving situation due to the pandemic as the worst experience in which it seemed to him that there is only sadness, distress without any hope of something good. He describes the present state of his mind as being filled with hopelessness and fear. He states that to add to his distress was the new symptoms of pain abdomen and bowel disturbances in his mother. The thoughts of having a recurrence terrified him for which he desperately wanted to visit the hospital. However considering his mother at high risk of complications from the COVID-19 infections, he was too perplexed to decide what to do. Another thought of his children being at risk of the infection if he visited a hospital heightened his anxiety. He recalls himself having sleepless nights wondering what is better in the current scenario for the safety of his whole family without adversely affecting his mother's health. He remembered having episodes of anger, frustration on his kids and wife over small immaterial things. However, when the situation continued and had almost felt devastated for >2 months he finally thought to visit the hospital once.\nWhen he presented to the outpatient department to show his mother, it seemed evident that he was in great psychological distress. The mother was evaluated and suspected of an infection for which treatment was prescribed. However, we thought of communicating with him regarding his fears, distress, and anxiety. Once he was comfortable, he expressed his distress which he stated had completely ruined his life. He discussed his worries and slowly and gradually felt much better. We followed them using teleconsultation and found that his negative symptoms such as helplessness, anger, and distress had decreased and he felt good to be with his family.","{

"A 52-year-old female who recently recovered from a myocardial infarction following a coronary angiography and stenting was not fortunate enough to be in good health thereafter. She developed symptoms such as pain upper abdomen, feeling of fullness even with small meals, and loss of appetite just 1 month after her stenting. Perplexed by her symptoms, she visited the hospital in January 2020. She underwent a battery of investigations including an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which suggested a growth at the lower end of the stomach compromising the gastric outlet. After having a tissue diagnosis of adenocarcinoma stomach, the patient was devastated and worried about the outcome the disease will have for her. The patient developed a ray of hope when she was planned for surgery considering the localized nature of the disease. She was informed that an early diagnosis and treatment will have favorable outcomes for her. She was scared by the outcomes and extensive nature of the surgery but still hoped to get through it and be better.\nHowever, when her surgery time neared, the country had been hit by the pandemic. Because of the few people being diagnosed of coronavirus, the hospital where her surgery was planned decided to put on hold major elective surgeries to avoid the risk of coronavirus to patients. She was informed that her surgery was canceled to avoid any risk to her health considering her high risk for complications because of the pandemic. She recalled that she felt like the floor slipped off from under her. Her caregiver stated that they understood that the decision of postponing of surgery was in their favor, but they were distressed by the fact that what if it progressed. Their mind kept wondering if there was some way that they could get the surgery done and still did not get the infection. They were advised certain home-based medications for the disease to tide over some time.\nAfter 1½ months of this, the patient presented in the emergency department of our hospital with progressively increasing dysphagia, multiple episodes of vomiting, and significant weight loss. On initial stabilizing, a scan was done which suggested complete gastric outlet obstruction along with metastatic spread to the liver. It was informed that all that could be done for her in the present situation is a feeding jejunostomy to help her intake of food. Because in the present cachexic situation, it will take her some time to build up before she can tolerate a chemotherapy. This left the patient and her relative startled and they could not believe their ears. On explaining about the advanced nature of the disease, they were heart wrenched. The patient was annoyed at the entire situation and said I do not know whom to blame for my current situation. She said that ever since I was diagnosed with this disease, the only good thing I thought was its early stage. But now, because of this pandemic, although I did not get infected, should I be happy or be furious that I am in an even worse situation nearing death. It was a difficult conversation which led us wondering what went wrong that she is in such a situation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Large right IIA aneurysm diagnosed during routine surveillance'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Comorbidities': ['Chronic renal failure', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperlipidaemia'], 'PastSurgeries': ['Endovascular AAA repair for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm', 'Endovascular repair for bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms with subsequent rupture of right external iliac artery']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Duplex ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms'}, {'Test': 'CT angiogram', 'Finding': 'IIA aneurysm expanded to a diameter of 6.4 cm with type II endoleak from collaterals'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'IIA aneurysm', 'Type': 'Vascular', 'Location': 'Right IIA'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Embolisation of collateral vessels and aneurysm sac', 'Details': 'Selective embolisation of branches feeding gluteal artery and main aneurysm sac using embolism coils and liquid embolic agent'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing surveillance', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Stable aneurysm excluded from circulation'}}}"
"A 48-year old Caucasian man presented to clinic for evaluation of his options for the treatment of brainstem fibrosarcoma. In 1977, 26 years prior to this presentation, the patient was diagnosed with a large pituitary adenoma based on a head computer tomography. Biopsy was not performed at the time. However, he received conformal fractionated radiotherapy of unknown dose. He also had concurrent hydrocephalus and a ventriculo–peritoneal shunt was placed. The patient was asymptomatic until 2003 when he started to develop eye left eyelid drooping and diplopia. A magnetic resonance study performed in February of 2004 showed a right brainstem lesion. Stereotactic needle brain biopsy was performed but the results were inconclusive. The patient was followed with serial neuroimaging until August of 2006 when the tumor experienced significant growth associated with progressive neurologic impairment. At that time a second stereotactic biopsy was performed, which also failed to show the pathology of the tumor. In May of 2007, the patient underwent subtotal resection of his large right pontine enhancing mass. Pathology results revealed that the tissue was most consisted with grade 2 fibrosarcoma. Post operatively the patient suffered a pseudomeningocele at the incision site, which required a VP shunt revision. Subsequently he presented to our clinic for reevaluation of this therapeutic options. After careful consideration of the different options available we decided to use a combination of metronomic cyclophosphamide at 50 mg a day and Imatinib 400 mg a day. The choice of Imatinib was based on the newest published data on the soft-tissue sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors sensitivity to Imatinib [] and the recent clinical trials showing that this chemotherapy agent is a potential option for primary malignant gliomas []. Cyclophosphamide is very commonly used in the treatment of multiple CNS malignancies such as malignant glioma and meningioma [], and also shows good activity in the treatment of systemic fibrosarcoma [] which motivates our decision to include this drug in this patient’s regimen.\nThe patient tolerated the treatment well, with slow improvement in his neurologic function and with minimal (grade II) chemotherapy-related hematologic toxicities. No treatment discontinuation was needed. Serial magnetic resonance studies of the brain showed that the tumor did not grow over the course of 6 month of chemotherapy, measures being stable at 30.2 mm × 35 mm (November 2007) and 30.4 mm × 35 mm (May 2008) (Fig. c–f). Unfortunately, the patient expired due to bacterial pneumonia with subsequent Gram negative sepsis while continuing to experience neurologic improvement, 6 months after the onset of chemotherapy. At the wish of the family, no autopsy was performed.\nThe pathology report indicated that the subtotal resection specimen was most consistent with brainstem tissue (Fig. c, d). Microscopical analysis if the specimen revealed spindle cell proliferation, with mild to moderate pleomorphism (Fig. a, b). These cells were also negative for EMA, GFAP, Keratin, Melan-A and S 100 (Fig. d). In some areas, ten to fifteen percent of these cells reacted with Ki-67 (Fig. h). These areas were also positive for Vimentin (Fig. f) and showed a delicate reticulin network (Fig. e). Faint to moderate positivity for p53 was demonstrated in some areas. A desmin stain was also positive. Within the brain tissue there were some areas of necrosis in which macrophages could be seen.\nT1 weighted axial and sagittal images delineated a gadolinium enhancing midbrain mass with lesional edema. T2 weighted axial images demonstrated a heterogenous hyperintensity corresponding to the gadolinium-enhancing areas (Fig. ). Compared o the MRI from May 2007 the MRI from November 2007 showed rapidly expanding tumor (Fig. ). The follow-up MRIs obtained at 6 months showed stability of the tumor over a period of 6 month (Fig. ).","{

"A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures –). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed layer by layer by using 3/0 resorbable polyglaction for the facia and the subcutaneous layers and 3/0 polypropylene sutures for the skin. After the surgery, pressure bandage was applied for the edema control externally and the patient was ordered soft diet for a week. The postoperative healing was uneventful, and at the sixth month follow-up visit, ideal closure of the fistula was observed (Figures and ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Decreased visual acuity in the left eye after autologous fat injection in periocular area'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI scan', 'Finding': 'Ill-defined hyperintense lesion at the left insular cortex'}, {'Test': 'Fluorescein angiography', 'Finding': 'Markedly prolonged choroidal filling around the optic disc and delay in retinal arterial filling in left eye'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Ophthalmic artery obstruction', 'Type': 'Vascular disorder', 'Location': 'Left eye'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Ocular massage, intravenous mannitolization, and oxygen and carbon dioxide therapy', 'Details': 'Prompt administration of these treatments following diagnosis'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Visual acuity of the left eye remained no light perception, marked retinal edema, and multiple fat emboli'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No perception of light in left eye, optic atrophy, multiple retinal hemorrhages, and fibrous change on posterior pole'}}}"
"Mrs. S, a 36-year-old patient underwent IVF for tubal factor infertility in January 2007, with beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) being positive on 20 Jan 2007. Early ultrasound showed a twin pregnancy, each containing a yolk sac and a live embryo. One sac was placed low towards the cervical canal while the other sac was placed towards the fundus, corresponding to 6 weeks of gestation. Early ultrasound suggested the possibility of a low implantation but did not confirm heterotopic pregnancy. On 4 Feb 2007, the patient was hospitalized in view of one episode of bleeding pervaginum. Keeping in mind the diagnosis of threatened abortion, she was managed conservatively and was discharged after 3 days. A repeat ultrasound at 7 weeks and 5 days of gestation confirmed the diagnosis of intrauterine and cervical heterotropic pregnancy []. The patient was readmitted on 19 Feb 2007. Fetal reduction of cervical pregnancy was performed under general anesthesia by injecting intrathoracic potassium chloride under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The cardiac activity of the intrauterine fetus was found to be normal after the procedure was completed. The patient was discharged after 2 days. The rest of the pregnancy went uneventfully, except for mild vaginal spotting off and on. At 28 weeks of gestation, the patient was readmitted with asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Fetal Doppler study on ultrasound showed reduced umbilical blood flows with adequate liquor and normal middle cerebral artery blood flows. She was serially monitored with biweekly ultrasound for fetal Doppler blood flow studies. At 31 weeks of gestation, a lower segment cesarean section was performed in view of absent end diastolic umbilical arterial fetal blood flow with reduced amniotic fluid index (amniotic fluid index 5). A male baby weighing 1.16 kg was born on 26 July 2007. Intraoperatively, the lower uterine segment showed presence of trophoblastic tissue and hemostatic sutures had to be taken in view of active bleeding from the anterior wall near the isthmus. The lower segment was ballooned up. Post-operative ultrasonography showed the presence of small amounts of trophoblastic tissue with low vascularity, suggestive of non-active tissue. Beta hCG levels performed immediately pre-operatively fell from 21,250 to 250 mIU/ ml 4 days after lower segment caesarean section. The patient was discharged on the 6th post-operative day in satisfactory condition. The baby was doing fine post-natally.","{

"An 18-year-old male reported to our emergency department with a history of pain in the right shoulder and inability to move it without significant discomfort. He reported that he had been assaulted 4 weeks before the presentation and had sustained head injuries. He had been admitted elsewhere for the management of those injuries and had been managed on an indoor basis for 16 days. His shoulder discomfort had not been thought to be serious during his stay in that hospital. Orthopaedic consultation had been recommended at the time of discharge. Examination revealed a reasonably maintained contour of the shoulder with total restriction of abduction. The patient was able to internally rotate the shoulder up to 20° and external rotation was not possible (Figs. , , ).\nRadiographs of the shoulder showed that the proximal humerus was fractured, and the proximal end of the distal fragment had migrated proximally to lie under the deltoid giving it a near normal contour. The head was dislocated inferiorly. This was confirmed by the axillary view. A significant callus had formed around the head and the shaft at their new position of contact.\nIt was obvious that the proximal pull on the distal fragment had made it migrate proximally.\nAccording to these findings, open reduction and reconstruction of the proximal humerus were considered necessary. Under general anaesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position and the glenohumeral joint was assessed via a deltopectoral approach. The axillary nerve was palpated to ascertain its position. The long head of the biceps was still intact. The glenoid cavity and the proximal humerus were exposed, and granulation tissue and the callus were cleared from it. After meticulous removal of the scar tissue, the glenoid articular cartilage looked to be in good condition and the humeral head was reduced.\nAs expected, it was not possible to reduce the distal fragment to its normal position beneath the head of the humerus. The end was stripped of soft tissue and shortened by 2 cm. This made the reduction possible beneath the head. The supraspinatus was reattached to the tuberosity area. The other muscles were reefed along with the capsule of the shoulder joint.\nThe wound was covered in layers, and the shoulder immobilised in 45° of internal rotation. After 4 weeks, pendular exercises were started with gradual institution of range of motion exercises. The final range of motion was recorded after 1 year when the patient had a more than normal internal rotation with an external rotation of 15°. However, abduction was only 25° at the joint. The flexion was 70° and the extension 20°. The patient was pain free and was able to perform his routine duties.\nThe X-ray, however, showed a gradual superior subluxation of the shoulder joint which was suggestive of undue tissue tension and rotator cuff insufficiency.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Painful swelling in the left eye with gradual increase over 8 months', 'Dull continuous pain in the eye and periorbital area', 'Progressive diminution of vision for the last 6 months, complete blindness in the affected eye'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousTreatment': 'Local doctor prescribed eye drops and oral medications, no significant treatment history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Noncontrast CT scan of the orbit', 'Finding': 'Marked left proptosis with a hyperdense mass extending into left anterior cranial fossa and destruction of orbital walls'}, {'Test': 'FNAC', 'Finding': 'Microscopic examination shows small, round cells suggestive of retinoblastoma'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Retinoblastoma', 'Type': 'Intraocular tumor', 'Location': 'Left eye'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Further investigations and management', 'Details': 'Treatment plan based on FNAC results, including chemotherapy and possible surgical intervention'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Ongoing treatment plan with regular monitoring', 'DischargeStatus': 'Under medical care'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'To be determined based on treatment response', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Dependent on treatment outcomes'}}}"
"A 60 years old male presented in June 2010, to our department with complaints of severe pain and swelling in left hip and upper thigh region since last 2 days, following a history of trauma. He was unable to walk and bear weight on the left lower limb following the trauma. Pain was present on the anterior and lateral aspect of left hip and upper thigh region. It was constant in nature, was present even at rest, dull aching type, severe in intensity and aggravated by hip movements. It was accompanied with difficulty in walking due to pain and the patient was unable to bear weight on the left lower limb. It was also associated with diffuse swelling over the upper part of thigh.\nThe patient had a history of hip hemireplacement operation on the left side 5 years back. There was no other significant past history. Patient was a sedentary worker with no history of tobacco or drug intake. No sensitivity or allergy to any drug. There was no family history of tuberculosis or malignancy. On examination the left lower limb was externally rotated. There was a diffuse swelling over antero-lateral aspect of upper part of left thigh. The skin overlying the swelling was neither warm nor inflamed. There was deep tenderness over the swelling. Bony crepitus was present and there was loss of transmitted movements. There was no apparent shortening or true shortening. Straight leg raising test was negative. Distal neurovascular status of the limb was intact.\nRoutine blood investigations were under normal limits. Plain radiographs of the left hip and thigh showed a Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic fracture with a broken cemented bipolar prosthesis insitu []. There was sufficient bone stock and there was no osteopenia and osteolysis.\nThe patient was planned for surgery with options for internal fixation of the fracture with revision of the prosthesis, and reconstruction of proximal femur with proximal femoral mega prosthesis.\nThe hip was opened by posterior approach. The head of the broken prosthesis was removed easily but the stem was well fixed in the bone stock and could not be removed despite of all the efforts. So we opted for proximal femoral replacement with customized hip mega prosthesis. An osteotomy of the greater trochanter was performed and it was raised separately along with the attached abductors. The rest of the proximal part of the femur up to the fracture site was resected and removed along with the broken prosthesis. It was replaced by long stem steel cemented proximal femoral mega prosthesis. The remaining portion of the greater trochanter along with the abductors was attached to the ports provided at the lateral side of the prosthesis. Wound was closed over a suction drain. The patient was allowed to bear weight after removal of the stitches on the 12th post operative day with the help of four post walker. He has completed 2 years of follow up and is totally asymptomatic, pain free and walks independently without support.","{

"A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures –). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed layer by layer by using 3/0 resorbable polyglaction for the facia and the subcutaneous layers and 3/0 polypropylene sutures for the skin. After the surgery, pressure bandage was applied for the edema control externally and the patient was ordered soft diet for a week. The postoperative healing was uneventful, and at the sixth month follow-up visit, ideal closure of the fistula was observed (Figures and ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Worsening dyspnea and hemoptysis for 2-3 days', 'Previous dyspnea and hoarseness, left vocal cord palsy', 'Mild stroke 6 years prior'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Fall from stairs 10 years ago, no injuries'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest X-ray', 'Finding': 'Large density in mediastinum, left pleural effusion'}, {'Test': 'Chest CT scan with contrast', 'Finding': '45 mm × 37 mm pseudoaneurysm in aortic arch, 9.5 cm × 10 cm hematoma in mediastinum'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Pseudoaneurysm of aortic arch', 'Type': 'Vascular condition', 'Location': 'Distal aortic arch, mediastinum'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical repair of pseudoaneurysm', 'Details': 'Left thoracotomy with femorofemoral bypass, evacuation of hematoma, aortic wall repair with patch'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'After 1 week'}}}"
"A 38-year-old Caucasian Greek man presented to our emergency department complaining of a three-month history of intermittent abdominal pain and frequent episodes of diarrhea. He had a history of a previous admission in another surgical department four months earlier for BAT after a road traffic accident. At that time he underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which showed no intraperitoneal fluid or solid organ injury, and he was admitted for observation. We also recovered from his discharge note that, during the first 48 hours of his hospitalization, a progressive decrease in the hematocrit value from 41% to 28% was noted. An abdominal CT scan at that time showed a small amount of fluid in the rectovesical pouch with no solid organ abnormalities and a large hematoma in the subcutaneous fat tissue on both lumbar areas. He was hemodynamically stable and he had a transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells and three units of fresh frozen plasma. He improved rapidly with conservative treatment and was discharged on the fifth day, asymptomatic. One month later he started to have episodes of vague abdominal pains and frequent episodes of diarrhea after meals. Our patient also mentioned that during that four-month period he had lost 10 kg in weight. Due to his fear of the resulting diarrhea, he had cut down on eating.\nOn our patient's current admission he complained of a colicky pain at the periumbilical region for the last 24 hours and two episodes of vomiting. On physical examination his abdomen was mildly distended with a diffuse tenderness on the hypogastrium. There was no rebound or guarding and palpation did not reveal any abdominal masses. His bowel sounds were increased. His blood tests were unremarkable. Plain abdominal X-rays revealed a dilated small bowel loop consistent with intestinal obstruction. He was initially treated with intravenous fluid replacement and nasogastric tube but his symptoms did not resolved. An enhanced-abdominal CT scan showed a small bowel loop with a thickened wall and narrow lumen with proximal bowel dilation. There was also increased density of the adjacent mesenteric fat (Figure ). Bearing in mind the episodes of diarrhea as well as the loss of weight, we included Crohn's disease in our differential diagnosis. Further investigation with colonoscopy and a barium enema did not reveal any pathology. In view of his continuing symptoms and the radiological evidence of a small bowel obstruction, a laparoscopic exploration was carried out. Due to multiple adhesions though, we had to convert our plan to a laparotomy. During the operation we found a thickened segment of ileum in his pelvis adherent to his bladder and the apex of the sigmoid loop. There was a stricture in his ileum at this point, and an ileosigmoid fistula was present (Figure ). The abnormal ileal loop was mobilized from his bladder and the sigmoid and resected, with restoration of intestinal continuity by primary side-to-side ileoileal anastomosis. The sigmoid fistula point was closed with seromucosal sutures. Histological examination of the resected specimen showed a mixed acute and chronic inflammatory process with hypertrophy of the muscularis externa. There was no evidence of Crohn's disease or malignancy. Our patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged from hospital nine days later. At follow-up eight months later, he was symptom free and had regained weight.","{

"A 50-year-old female presented with history of sudden onset weakness of right upper and lower limb for 1 day with deviation of angle of mouth to the left side. There was no history of headache, vomiting, seizures, or previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Also there was no history of chest pain, palpitations, or any cardiac disease. She is not a diabetic or hypertensive and there was no other comorbid illness. Her general examination revealed a pulse rate of 180/ min, regular, low volume, and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. The central nervous system examination showed normal higher mental functions, right upper motor neuron facial nerve palsy, and muscle power of 3/5 in upper limbs, 2/5 in lower in lower limbs with right extensor plantar response. The examination of other systems was normal. The laboratory investigations revealed normal liver and renal function tests. The serum calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels were normal. The serum troponin T and creatine phosphokinase levels were normal. The CT brain revealed left middle cerebral artery territory infarct measuring around 2×3 cm.\nOur patient presented to the emergency medical services department within 8 h of acute stroke. Her ECG showed regular narrow QRS complex long RP tachycardia at a rate of 186 beats per minute (bpm) with inverted p waves in lead III []. She had a normal study on echocardiography without structural changes or thrombus. On intravenous injection of 6 mg of adenosine, the patient transiently developed complete atrioventricular block but the atrial rate was persisting at the same 186 bpm with regular p waves separated by isoelectric baseline [] which reverted back to AT within a minute []. A diagnosis of atrial tachycardia was made and she was started on verapamil 40 mg three times daily orally. Following one dose of verapamil she developed sinus bradycardia (50 bpm). So verapamil was withheld and she was monitored in intensive care unit. In the following 1 week, she did not had any other episode of arrhythmia. Considering her elderly age, she was advised to undergo electrophysiological study to know whether she has any substrate for inducible arrhythmia but she did not consent for that. The ECG took before discharge showed normal sinus rhythm (64 bpm), with occasional premature atrial complex. One month later, she came for follow up and she did not report any palpitation and her ECG was in normal sinus rhythm with rate of 68 bpm.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Epigastric pain', 'Fatigue', '10 kg weight loss', 'Jaundice'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan of abdomen', 'Finding': '7 × 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass adjacent to the second part of the duodenum containing fluid and air'}, {'Test': 'Colonoscopy', 'Finding': 'Mucinous adenocarcinoma in the transverse colon'}, {'Test': 'Repeat CT scan', 'Finding': 'Localised colonic perforation with formation of an abscess adjacent to the duodenum, thickening of the ascending colon'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Mucinous adenocarcinoma', 'Type': 'Cancer', 'Location': 'Transverse colon'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Right hemicolectomy, retrograde cholecystectomy, expandable covered duodenal stent insertion, antrectomy, gastrojejunostomy', 'Details': 'Debulk tumour, resect residual tumour in gall bladder, insert duodenal stent, form gastrojejunostomy to bypass duodenum'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Prolonged but uncomplicated', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged after 7 weeks'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Survived without gastrointestinal symptoms'}}}"
"A 56 year old man had transient loss of consciousness while driving. His wife pulled over and, in A& E, he was found to have a large superior mediastinal shadow, extending into neck, on chest X-ray (Figure ). CT scan revealed a 7 cm × 11 cm saccular aneurysm arising from the distal aortic arch between the origins of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, with cephalic ectopy. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated large saccular aneurysm of the distal aortic arch with turbulent flow at the left subclavian artery. MR scan confirmed the presence of a large distal aortic arch aneurysm arising from the aortic arch between the origins of left common carotid and left subclavian arteries with extreme displacement of both vessels, the left common carotid artery being displaced anteriorly and to the right and also stretched and distorted owing to vertical expansion of the aneurysm posterior to it, and the left subclavian artery displaced well down and posteriorly into the left chest with even greater distortion (Figures and ). An aortogram clarified the situation further by showing that the aneurysm involved the arch beyond the origin of the left common carotid artery and that the left subclavian artery had been displaced by the aneurysm posteroinferiorly into the left chest. There was a great tortuosity and redundancy of the aorta between the two vessels and the aorta and aneurysm rose well into the neck. Coronary angiogram was normal.\nAt median sternotomy, the distal arch rose into the neck for a variable distance. There was a 9 cm × 11 cm aortic arch aneurysm arising distal to the left common carotid artery and proximal to the left subclavian artery, extending in both vertical and horizontal directions, with tortuosity and redundancy of the distal arch, causing compression, deviation and distortion of a number of adjacent structures (Figure ). Trachea was severely compressed with deviation to the right and the aneurysm formed a posterior relation of the ascending aorta and displaced it and the left common carotid artery anteriorly. The left pulmonary artery and the main pulmonary trunk were displaced posteriorly and inferiorly and the left vagus and the left phrenic nerves were stretched over the entire length of the aneurysm. Ascending aorta and proximal arch were normal sized. The proximal descending aorta was diffusely atheromatous. In order to get a better access to the descending aorta, a T shaped anterolateral extension was made in the 4th space. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted with common femoral arterial and right atrial venous cannulations and patient cooled to 14°C. Left ventricle was vented through right superior pulmonary vein. Under lower body deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (LBDHCA) and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP), the arch aneurysm was excised and a 30 mm VASCUTEK interposition graft used to establish the continuity between the arch distal to the left common carotid artery and the proximal part of the descending aorta (Figure ). The left subclavian artery was ligated and not reimplanted as it was severely atheromatous along its entire length. Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion was achieved through external cannulation of the left common carotid artery by a 10 F MEDTRONIC perfusion cannula using IL/min flow.\nPatient was extubated on first postoperative day and, except for mild hoarseness of voice which improved, made uncomplicated postoperative recovery. Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and he was discharged home on seventh postoperative day. Follow up MR scan 4 months later showed satisfactory repair (Figure ) although he needed thyroplasty with a titanium clip for left vocal cord palsy. He continues to be fully active and asymptomatic 4 years after surgery and his follow up MR scans are normal.","{

"A 50-year-old woman with an extensive medical history including spina bifida and hydrocephalus with placement of VA shunt and subsequent VP shunt due to VA shunt failure, both in her early 20s, presented with worsening shortness of breath for several years. An echocardiogram revealed normal left and right ventricular size, and systolic function however showed severe pulmonic valve insufficiency secondary to a migrated VA shunt catheter into the pulmonary artery [Figure and ]. Color Doppler and continuous wave Doppler assessment was consistent with severe pulmonic insufficiency with large regurgitant jet size and broadwidth (vena contracta jet width to transpulmonary annulus ratio 64%) as well as a dense jet on continuous wave Doppler with greatly increased pulmonic systolic flow compared to systemic flow by pulsed wave Doppler [Figure and ]. She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram to assess her functional capacity but was only able to tolerate 3 min of exercise on a standard Bruce protocol, achieving 4.6 METS with a peak heart rate of 210 bpm (124% of the maximum predicted heart rate) limited by exertional dyspnea. The stress echocardiogram was nondiagnostic for the detection of ischemia due to submaximal workload achieved; however, no segmental wall motion abnormalities were seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased from 27 to 58 mmHg with exercise. She previously presented to the hospital with chest pain after outpatient pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging test that revealed moderate ischemia and scarring of the apical anterior and apical walls. She had coronary angiography, which did not reveal obstructive coronary artery disease but identified the migrated VA shunt catheter into the pulmonary artery []. Computed tomography scan of the chest with contrast was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism and further evaluate the migrated shunt catheter, which was negative for pulmonary embolism, and the retained catheter was noted to be coiling in the main pulmonary artery []. A multidisciplinary team discussion was held, and removal of this entrenched indwelling catheter through endovascular approach was considered to be too risky. She subsequently underwent open surgical intracardiac catheter removal and repair of the pulmonary artery with a bovine pericardial patch. The majority of the catheter was easily retrieved; however, there were areas that were embedded into the right ventricle myocardial wall as well as the superior vena cava []. The portion of the catheter adherent to the right ventricle wall was carefully excised; however, the adhesion to the superior vena cava was extensive and was therefore that portion was left in place. The pulmonic valve appeared to be well functioning, and it was deemed not necessary to proceed with pulmonic valve replacement. An echocardiogram obtained 2 months after the surgery showed improvement of pulmonic insufficiency, and the shunt catheter was no longer visualized. At 6-month follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in her symptom.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Increased shortness of breath', 'Dyspnea on exertion', 'Orthopnea', 'Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate', 'Melena with drop in hemoglobin'], 'MedicalHistory': {'CoronaryArteryDisease': {'History': 'Multiple myocardial infarctions with coronary stents placed in 2003 and additional stents placed two months prior to admission'}, 'HeartFailure': {'Type': 'Systolic heart failure', 'EjectionFraction': '20%'}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Progressive worsening of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 18%'}, {'Test': 'Esophagogastroduodenoscopy', 'Finding': 'Erythema and erosions in the gastric fundus, grade 1 reflux esophagitis'}, {'Test': 'Colonoscopy', 'Finding': 'Abnormal vascularity, congestion, nodularity, erosions, erythema, and ulceration in the cecum and ascending colon'}, {'Test': 'CT of abdomen and pelvis', 'Finding': 'Ischemic colitis of the cecum and ascending colon, IABP positioning causing occlusion'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Ischemic colitis', 'Type': 'Gastrointestinal condition', 'Location': 'Cecum and ascending colon'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Repositioning of IABP', 'Details': 'Resolution of melena'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Resolved melena', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing monitoring', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improving with treatment'}}}"
"A 43 year old female with chronic back pain developed depression and attempted suicide with an overdose of diazepam and methadone after an argument with her husband in the evening. She intentionally consumed approximately 40 to 50 tablets of diazepam at 5 mg strength as well as an unknown quantity of methadone tablets was found the following day in an unresponsive state with a respiratory state of only 4 breaths per minute but was revived at a local hospital with the use of naloxone. Although she could awaken and answer questions appropriately, this was only transient and required a naloxone drip infusion over 24 hours; no flumazenil had been used. Her potassium was also elevated initially at 7.6 that later normalized and had a leukocytosis secondary to mild aspiration pneumonia that was successfully treated with antibiotics. She was discharged within one week in a much improved state to a psychiatric facility. After two days as in-patient for psychiatric care, she was discharged to home in a markedly improved state with a mental status that was back to her baseline and fully able to be self-sufficient without any cognitive deficits. Interview with family and friends confirmed that she was cognitively normal and fine up until 3 weeks after the event when she abruptly changed midday and seemed confused and forgetful with a rapid worsening the following day. She was first noted not be able to play cards with her family, had developed social withdrawal with a lack of personal hygiene, and became incontinent as well. She appeared very lethargic and not very interactive. After this continued for approximately 5 days without any improvement, she was evaluated at the Emergency Dept. and admitted after a CT head exam disclosed marked and diffuse hypointensity throughout the subcortical white matter (). This was later evaluated by MRI as being a confluent change throughout the entire white matter, and appeared diffusely hyperintense on both FLAIR and T2 weighted sequences (), with hyper-intensity also noted on diffusion weighted imaging. The unusual feature though was that the cerebellar white mater had been spared, and that the change was a strictly supratentorial effect () without altering signal intensity for the white matter tracts in the internal capsule and brain stem area. Using large voxels placed over the semi-centrum ovale, MR spectroscopic analysis at 1.5 Tesla showed elevated abnormal elevations in the choline and creatinine peaks with a small peak seen for lactic acid as well (). Neurological exam revealed a blunted flat affect with abnormally slow gait and left side neglect, with disorientation and very poor short term recall. As the patient had a detectable benzodiazepine level at approximately 83 ng/mL, 1.0 mg flumazenil was given in 0.2 mg increments every 30 seconds during EEG monitoring. Although background slowing improved slightly, there was a clear and definite transient neurological improvement. Serum benzodiazepine levels continued to decline from 67.9 to 32.8 ng/mL over 4 days, with modest clinical improvement in her mental status also observed. Follow-up evaluation revealed substantial improvement both clinically and radiographically, with a normal mental status and normal MR imaging of the brain within one year of the event, with normal metabolism of both the gray and white matter of the brain, as assessed by 18F-FDG PET imaging ().","{

"A 42-year-old right-handed man was referred to our neurosurgery department for generalized epileptic seizures, muscular weakness of both upper and lower limbs, gait instability and headache. The patient was suffering from recurrent seizures since his childhood and was under anticonvulsant treatment with phenobarbital and valproic acid. He was a heavy smoker and had a history of dyslipidemia and allergy in amoxicillin. Also, in the past, the patient underwent a surgery on his right hip after a traffic accident that he had 2 years before.\nHis clinical examination showed increased reflexes of his left leg without other neurological findings. A brain CT scan without contrast was initially performed and revealed a lesion in his right parietal-occipital lobe. The additional intravenous administration of contrast medium showed that the dimensions of the lesion were 7.5 × 2 × 4.6 cm. The contrast uptake and the density of the tumor were heterogeneous. There was also 1 cm middle line shift to the left as well as elevation of the right occipital horn. The patient had screws in his right hip, which were surgically removed in order to perform an MRI for further investigation of the tumor. MRI examination confirmed the existence of a lesion in the right occipital lobe, nearby the occipital horn compatible with the image of a low grade glioma (). The patient did not have any visual disorders as the opthalmologists reported before surgery. Also, blood exams did not reveal any numerical or functional disorders. The CT of the thorax, pelvis, upper and lower abdomen did not show any other pathological signs. The patient was scheduled for an occipital craniotomy for biopsy and depending on the result, resection or not of the lesion. Due to the inability of the biopsy to clarify the type of the tumor and considering the young age of the patient, we proceeded to surgical excision of the tumor. Intraoperative neuromonitoring (motorsensory and visual evoked potentials) and neuronavigation were used. The tumor was resected with the use of microscope and CUSA. A post-surgical MRI was performed after the operation and confirmed the subtotal excision of lesion (). CSF analysis did not reveal any pathological findings. Histopathological analysis revealed DLBCL () and the patient was referred to hematologists-oncologists of our hospital for further treatment manipulations. The patient was treated with radiotherapy and methotrexate and 16 months after his surgery is still tumor free.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Progressive dyspnea', 'Dull headache in the occipital area', '6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side', 'Increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PrimaryDiagnosis': 'Giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk', 'PreviousInjury': 'Endovascular trapping of giant ICA aneurysm involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MR imaging', 'Finding': 'Giant aneurysm of the basilar artery compressing the brain stem'}, {'Test': 'Cerebral angiography', 'Finding': 'Fusiform giant aneurysm involving the basilar trunk'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk', 'Type': 'Cerebrovascular disease', 'Location': 'Basilar artery'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Endovascular embolization', 'Details': 'Coil embolization of the basilar trunk aneurysm'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Recovered without further neurologic deficit', 'DischargeStatus': 'Independent daily activity became possible after one month'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Three months and one year post-treatment', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Currently leading a normal life as a housewife'}}}"
"A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures –). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed layer by layer by using 3/0 resorbable polyglaction for the facia and the subcutaneous layers and 3/0 polypropylene sutures for the skin. After the surgery, pressure bandage was applied for the edema control externally and the patient was ordered soft diet for a week. The postoperative healing was uneventful, and at the sixth month follow-up visit, ideal closure of the fistula was observed (Figures and ).","{

"A 22-year-old intoxicated male without any medical comorbidity was involved in a motor vehicle accident when he lost control of his automobile in a residential area and ultimately collided into a house. The patient was unrestrained and did not lose consciousness in the accident. Emergency medical personnel at the scene did report the deployment of the airbags with the patient displaying a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. He was emergently brought to the trauma center in stable condition. His primary survey revealed diminished breath sounds over his right hemithorax in conjunction with an increased respiratory rate. On further examination, he did appear to have crepitus over his right clavicle and gross deformity in his right thigh. Neurologic and vascular examinations of his extremities were normal.\nRadiographic analysis of his chest revealed a right proximal third clavicle fracture with inferior displacement complicated by a partial pneumothorax (). He had also sustained a displaced femoral shaft fracture. A chest thoracostomy tube was inserted emergently into the right pleural cavity and placed under suction to inflate the lung. Further radiographic studies including computerized tomography images confirmed that the fractured clavicle had penetrated the pleural cavity and caused a partial lung collapse (). The patient was initially placed in a sling for the clavicle fracture to allow access to the thoracostomy site. The patient underwent intramedullary nailing of his femur with a centromedullary device without complication the day of his injury. Due to the magnitude of displacement of the clavicle fracture, it was thought that achieving union with nonoperative modalities would be problematic. Pulmonary alveolar tissue seemed to be interposed in the fracture site further complicating the probability of union as well pneumothorax resolution with conservative treatment. The patient was counseled regarding both the orthopedic and cardiopulmonary risks of the surgery. If a closed reduction was unsuccessful, he was informed that an open reduction would be indicated. He understood the possible complications and wished to proceed. 2 days after stabilization of his femur fracture, the patient had an open reduction with internal fixation of his right clavicle.\nThe patient was positioned supine on a radiolucent table. After multiple unsuccessful attempts at closed reduction, a traditional anterior approach was employed to gain access to the fracture (). Once the fracture was exposed and the chest tube under suction, a pointed reduction clamp was used to retract the lateral fragment from the pleural cavity (). There was noted to be some comminution at the fracture site. A general trauma surgeon was available in the operating room in case of any cardiopulmonary compromise. The patient’s vital signs and oxygenation remained stable throughout the operative procedure. After debridement of the fracture ends, the fracture was reduced and provisionally fixed with a bone holding reduction clamp. A six-hole locking 3.5 mm dynamic compression plate was affixed to the clavicle with hybrid screw technique to achieve stable fixation ().\nOn the 2nd post-operative day, his chest thoracostomy tube was removed without incident. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 3rd postoperative day. At 6-month follow-up, the patient did not complain of pulmonary symptoms. His wounds were well healed and he had regained full active range of motion of his shoulder. Repeat radiographs showed no residual pneumothorax and a healed clavicle fracture ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chest and back pain for two weeks', 'Non-responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': True, 'PreviousMedicalProcedures': ['Thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR)']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CTA of the aorta', 'Findings': {'DissectionFlap': 'From left subclavian artery to renal arteries', 'EnlargementOfFalseLumen': True, 'AneurysmalDilatation': True, 'CompressionofTrueLumen': True, 'EntryPoint': '2 cm distal to right subclavian artery', 'AberrantRightSubclavianArtery': True, 'LeftVertebralArtery': 'Directly from aortic arch'}}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Aortic dissection', 'Type': 'Type A', 'Location': 'Descending thoracic aorta'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR)', 'Details': 'Stent graft used to cover intimal tear and obliterate false lumen'}, 'PostoperativeCourse': {'Recovery': 'Successful with intact peripheral pulses', 'DischargeStatus': 'One day after surgery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3-6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No evidence of morbidity'}}}"
"The 55 years old male patient received a locking distal tibial plate along with distal fibular plate 3years back from UAE. Now patient came with complaint of non healing ulcer over medial aspect of lower 1/3rd of right leg from past 1 year. Patient was also type 2 diabetic diagnosed 5 years back. Non operative management did not improve the symptoms. The patient consented to implant removal, with the express understanding that implant removal might be impossible because already one failed attempt had been performed at some other hospital six months back. One of the 5 proximal locking screws was removed using the standard screwdriver. Rest of the proximal screws were stripped headed. For their extraction we used the AO synthes screw extraction kit along with conical extraction screw (AO Synthes) but the screws did not come out. The carbide drill was not available at that time. We then decided to proceed with the new technique. The rest of the proximal screws were removed using a technique not previously described. We used stainless steel metal cutting blades that are used to cut door locks or pad locks to cut the remaining stripped headed screws. Firstly, after exposing the plate to be removed a space is created between locking plate and bone adjacent to screws to be cut with the help of sharp osteotome. Then an iron cutting blade which was previously autoclaved introduced between plate and bone adjacent to screws to be cut and with to and fro motion all the remaining screws were cut. The remaining threaded parts of screws were left in the bone because there removal may further weaken the bone. Overall 2 blades were used to cut the 4 screws. Screws were cut with care with slow to and fro motion of blades but with firm pressure on blade to avoid any unnecessary soft tissue injury. It only takes 10 minutes to cut all the remaining 4 proximal screws and there was no heating problem during the cutting of screws as there is with other procedures such carbide drills and high speed burrs. At the end of the procedure, the surgical wound was washed thoroughly with normal saline to remove metal debris. We name this technique as Rohit’s technique for removal of stripped headed/jammed interlocking screws.","{

"We report a rare malposition of a PA catheter secondary to kinking in a 63-year-old male who was scheduled for an off-pump coronary artery by-pass graft. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus with neuropathy, early stage nephropathy and retinopathy. The pre-operative echocardiogram was significant for diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis with a corresponding ejection fraction of 51 %. The right ventricle size was normal and there was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. After placement of standard monitors and preoxygenation of the patient, midazolam, fentanyl and rocuronium were administered. The patient was then intubated and maintenance of anesthesia was achieved using 1 % sevoflurane along with a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Subsequently, an arterial line was placed and a central venous catheter and a sheath for a PA catheter were inserted in the right internal jugular vein. The patient showed stable hemodynamics throughout the insertion of the catheters.\nDuring insertion of the PA catheter, we monitored the pressure waveform from the distal catheter port. The catheter was advanced to the right ventricle at a depth of 40 cm, then, was further advanced to the pulmonary artery at a depth of 55 cm. However, it was relatively easy to drop back the catheter to the right ventricle. Even after several attempts, no stable pulmonary artery waveform was obtained. We then discovered that the distal and proximal ports presented the same waveform pattern. We made the range of the two pressure lines the same and then realized that the two waveforms were completely identical (Fig. ).\nWe first suspected a mechanical problem with the catheter itself such as communication between lumens, so we flushed saline in each lumen. This changed each waveform independently, thus, communication between lumens seemed to be unlikely. Although we tried to remove the catheter, it was firmly in place at 15 cm depth. Flushing of cold saline through the distal port and placement of a guide wire were not successful in attempts to remove the catheter. We then utilized portable fluoroscopy to visualize the catheter in situ. We were able to determine that the catheter had formed a kink around the apex of the right ventricle (Fig. ). With the use of a guide wire and alternating patient body position, we were able to straighten the catheter, which allowed for its subsequent removal. The removed catheter showed evidence of bend at the distal site of the thermo-dilution lead (Fig. ). While reinsertion of new PA catheter, fluoroscopy showed that a kink started to form around the apex of the right ventricle. However, this time we advanced the PA catheter successfully using fluoroscopy and alternations in patient body position. Thereafter, the surgical procedure and postoperative course were both uneventful.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Inability to open mouth wide for dental treatment'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at one year of age'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Type': 'Neuromuscular Disorder', 'Location': 'N/A'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Local Anesthesia for TMJ area', 'Details': '0.5% levobupivacaine injected on each side of the TMJ and temporalis fascia'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No pain reported during dental treatment', 'DischargeStatus': 'Treatment ongoing'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Limited mouth opening ability (20 mm)'}}}"
"A 55-year-old male reported with complaints of a gradually enlarging lump in the left side of the abdomen over a period of 5 months associated with dull aching pain and occasional vomiting. On examination there was a huge mass of around 25 × 20 cm spanning the whole abdomen with an irregular surface and variable soft to firm consistency. The ultrasonography of the abdomen suggested a large multiloculated cystic mass occupying the whole abdomen and pelvis, right kidney was normal but the left kidney could not be visualized. Contrast enhanced computer tomography of the abdomen showed a homogenous non enhancing retroperitoneal mass measuring approximately 17 × 21 cm with a mixed echogenic pattern in its anterolateral region (). The cystic mass occupied the whole of the abdomen displacing the pancreas and left ureter anteriorly and across the midline. A focus of calcification was seen at the pheriphery of the lesion. Left kidney and its pelvicalyceal system was not visualized. There was a loss of fat plans with the adjacent gut loops. An exploratory laparotomy was done and a large cystic mass with solid areas weighing around 7 kg was found in the left side of the abdomen adherent to the distal transverse colon, splenic flexure and the descending colon (). There was no identifiable left kidney. The tumor was resected en mass along with the adherent large bowel and a primary colo-colic anastamosis was done. The patient had an uneventful post operative course and was followed up for six months without recurrence.\nThe specimen grossly revealed 29 × 20 × 15 cm mass with marked congestion and a multinodular external surface, while the cut section revealed a multicystic mass with solid areas. Segment of large intestine measuring 5 cm was attached to it with no kidney identified grossly. Microsections showed a biphasic (epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation) malignant tumor with solid and cystic components infiltrating through the wall of the adherent bowel. However, the resection margins were free from the tumor. One of the sections showed a small amount of residual renal tissue at the periphery indicating that by and large the kidney was replaced by the tumor (). The immunohistochemistry panel revealed CD34, CD117, calretinin, desmin, LCA, synaptophysin and chromogranin negativity and, NSE positive (), patchy bcl2 positivity in ganglion cells and patchy EMA positive membrane. Hence the diagnosis of a retroperitoneal MPNST was made based on the clinic pathological co correlation.","{

"This patient is a 48 year old female who was admitted with a large fungating right breast mass which measured 22 × 20 cm and elevated 12 cm above the skin surface (Figure ). The patient stated that the mass began as a very small ""bump"" that she believed was a cyst. One year prior she had been evaluated by her primary care physician who described a bulging, red breast mass in the upper outer quadrant which measured at least 8 cm. Core biopsies were performed and the pathology revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm with dominant features of carcinoma and a suggestion of carcinosarcoma. The patient chose to not undergo treatment and allowed the mass to enlarge with resultant ulceration of the mass through the skin with centralized necrosis and bleeding of the mass. The patient's associated symptoms included a 50 pound weight loss over the previous 6 months with intermittent low-grade fevers.\nThe patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension and left ear deafness. No significant surgical history was reported and her family history was not significant for malignancies in any first degree relatives. Physical examination revealed a cachetic female in significant pain with a large, extensively necrotic mass on the right anterolateral breast and chest wall. The necrotic tissue was on an erythematous, dense mound of tissue that extended to the lateral and central chest wall. No cervical, supraclavicular, left axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy was appreciated on physical exam. There was palpable lymphadenopathy within the right axilla.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a right radical mastectomy. This encompassed removal of the entire pectoralis major and minor musculature down to the right chest wall, and a complete level III axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The skin flaps were viable, not grossly involved with tumor, and were able to be closed primarily (Figure ). The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged two days later. The patient developed a moderate amount of right upper extremity chronic lymphedema.\nThe final pathology of the right radical mastectomy revealed a high grade carcinosarcoma measuring 22 cm in greatest diameter (Figures &). There was extensive cutaneous ulceration with underlying dermal involvement by the tumor. The deep surgical margin of resection which included the pectoralis major and minor muscle was negative for tumor. A total of 2 of 28 axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinosarcoma with extranodal tumor extension identified. All surgical margins were negative for tumor. Immunohistochemical profile revealed a neoplasm with a dimorphic histology. The epithelial (carcinomatous) component stained positive for cytokeratin immunostain CAM5.2, and the mesenchymal (sarcomatous) component was negative for CAM5.2, actin and desmin, but positive for vimentin. The tumor was estrogen and progesterone receptor negative and not amplified for the HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Expression of HER-1/EGFR receptor was examined by immunohistochemistry with 70% of the cells expressing the EGFR protein, classified as moderate staining intensity (Figure ). Based on available data and using AJCC criteria, the final pathologic staging was a T4b, N1a, Mx, Stage IIIb lesion.\nA post-operative whole body PET/CT fusion scan and radionuclide bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease. As per NCCN guidelines regarding her stage of tumor, we recommended adjuvant radiation therapy to the chest wall and axilla in addition to chemotherapy. She received dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel and subsequently radiation therapy to the chest wall and axilla.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Left hip pain with no precipitating event', 'Worsening pain in contralateral hip'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalConditions': ['Mild Multiple Sclerosis'], 'MedicationHistory': {'Smoking': False, 'AlcoholConsumption': False, 'Corticosteroids': False, 'Anticonvulsants': False, 'Anticoagulants': False}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOP)', 'Type': 'Bone disorder', 'Location': 'Femoral necks in both hips'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Closed reduction and internal fixation', 'Details': 'Stabilized left hip with two hole 135 degree dynamic hip screws; right hip fixed in situ'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uncomplicated', 'DischargeStatus': 'Pain-free with no implant failure'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Pain-free with no evidence of avascular necrosis'}}}"
"A male patient aged 42 years reported to the department of maxillofacial surgery with the chief complaint of painless huge growth over left eye and loss of vision. History revealed that the patient was apparently alright 2 years back, when he first noticed a small pea nut size ulcerative growth over left lower eyelid near medial canthus. The growth was painless and persistent in growth. It was not associated with any kind of pain or fever. Initially eye site was normal but as the growth increased his vision started to diminish from left eye due to the increase in the size of growth, approximately 1 year before patient completely loses his vision from left eye. Only due to his extremely poor economic conditions he could not seek any sort of medical treatment.\nOn clinical examination the growth extended superoinferiorly from supraorbital ridge to ipsilateral alae of nose and mesiodistally from right inner canthus of eye to left side of maxillary buttress crossing midline (). Personal history was negative for any detrimental habits. On palpation superficial cervical nodes were not palpable. The growth was ulcerative, exophytic, and fungating and exudates were present. It was approximately 6 × 5 cms in size. The vision from right eye was normal and ocular movements in all directions were intact. All other parameters were within normal range. HR-CT scan was advised. The axial and coronal sections showed large homogenous mass covering the whole left orbit involving the globe but no erosive damage was seen in any of the bony structures (). Correlating the clinical history, examination, and radiological findings a provisional diagnosis of carcinoma of left lower eyelid was suggested. Incisional biopsy was performed and histopathological report revealed dermal invasion by abnormal cells from the epidermis, pleomorphism of the tumour cells with presence of keratinization within the cells which give the cells abundant pink cytoplasm, and intraepithelial keratin in the shape of a whorl which confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of lower eyelid involving the whole of the eye (). With all blood investigations repeated and keeping in mind the due risk of surgery in such a massive lesion, wide local excision of the tumour along with removal of all the contents of the respective orbit was planned along with elective neck dissection (Levels I and II). The patient was intubated using orotracheal intubation; skin incision was marked around the tumour leaving 1 cm of healthy looking skin all around which was quite a daunting task looking at the size of the tumor (). As the tumour was engulfing the whole of the globe as well as retrobulbar contents with the due consultation with the ophthalmologist, complete orbital exenteration was performed (). Elective neck dissection (I-II) performed simultaneously, and all the nodes and resected specimen were sent for the histopathological analysis. Next the pedicled temporalis muscle flap was harvested and was transpositioned medially onto left side of orbit and sutured with skin over the bridge of the nose (). Passive tube drain was placed beneath the temporalis muscle flap to drain any collection into the orbit. Split thickness skin graft was harvested from anteromedial side of left thigh approximately 4 × 3 inches and placed over the temporalis muscle flap (). The patient showed good compliance and the flap healed uneventfully.\nThe postsurgical histopathology reports confirmed the tumor-free surgical margins and the preoperative biopsy findings. All the nodes harvested from neck were free from metastasis. The patient was sent for radiotherapy (RT), 70 grays (Gy) for a period of six weeks. The patient is in follow-up for the past 10 months with no signs of recurrence or discomfort (). Ocular prosthesis was planned but looking retrospectively at the size of the tumor we still defer ourselves from giving the prosthesis and decided to wait for another 12 months.","{

"A 33-year-old female patient presented at the emergency room with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting that had persisted for a day. The patient had a history of child birth eight months prior, and had proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the left common femoral vein during the 36th week of pregnancy. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter had been inserted instead of anticoagulation due to the high risk of bleeding during pregnancy. Anticoagulation therapy was administered immediately after the birth of her child. Removal of the IVC filter was recommended one month after insertion, but the patient refused for personal reasons. On arriving at the emergency room, her vital signs were stable and the laboratory examination did not show abnormalities other than mild leukocytosis. The patient's prothrombin time international normalized ratio value at the emergency room was 1.31 due to irregular intake of warfarin. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that one of the IVC filter legs had penetrated the IVC wall and caused a duodenal perforation (). There was no evidence of thrombi in the lower IVC. An endoscopy was performed to evaluate the severity of duodenal injury. A protruding IVC filter leg was observed in the lumen of the third portion of the duodenum (). In addition, the duodenum mucous membrane on the opposite side showed erythema, erosion, and nodular changes, resembling chronically progressing penetration.\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed in order to remove the IVC filter and to repair the duodenum. Because there were concerns regarding the possible IVC rupture during surgery, a cannula was placed in the superior vena cava to provide extracorporeal circulation when needed. Also, the femoral artery and femoral vein were isolated for cannulation. The portions of the IVC and the duodenum, including the penetrations, were isolated behind the colon. When the duodenum was lifted up, we found the IVC filter leg between the IVC and the duodenum. We then cut the IVC filter leg and removed the IVC filter leg remnant from the duodenum portion. The duodenal perforation was repaired directly. The IVC was found to be densely adhered to the surrounding tissue including the aorta, and fixed to the adjacent structures. We concluded that isolation and removal of the IVC filter leg remnant in the IVC were more dangerous due to the risk of rupture. The remaining leg protruding from the IVC side to the duodenum was cutoff and removed ().\nAfter the surgery, ileus occurred and the patient started to eat by mouth after 14 days. The patient was discharged on the 20th postoperative day without any complications. The patient returned to work and is currently under follow-up observation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Sudden onset left-sided weakness and dysphasia'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousHealth': 'Previously healthy with no risk factors for stroke'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Brain CT', 'Finding': 'No established infarct'}, {'Test': 'CT cranial angiogram', 'Finding': 'Thrombus in proximal right middle cerebral artery'}, {'Test': 'Brain MRI', 'Finding': 'Multiple infarcts with haemorrhages in right middle cerebral artery territory and bilateral cerebellar hemisphere'}, {'Test': 'Echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Mobile mass in anterior mitral valve leaflet indicative of vegetation'}, {'Test': 'CT thorax, abdomen, pelvis', 'Finding': 'Large pelvic mass suggestive of right-sided ovarian tumor without evidence of metastasis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Infective endocarditis and ovarian clear cell carcinoma', 'Type': 'Infectious and neoplastic diseases', 'Location': 'Mitral valve and ovaries'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': ['Thrombolysis', 'Endovascular mechanical clot removal', 'Intravenous antibiotics'], 'Details': ['Thrombolytic therapy', 'Endovascular clot removal procedure', 'IV antibiotic course']}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful outcome with recovery to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 2'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved with ongoing treatment and surveillance'}}}"
"A 21-year-old Greek Caucasian female rowing athlete was injured on both thighs during field training. She had to train in sprint as part of her field training program. Upon acceleration, she experienced severe pain on both thighs and fell down. She continued to suffer from severe pain on the anterior surface of her thighs and tenderness with any attempt of movement. She was also unable to stand up and walk. Her trainer observed swelling and loss of function immediately after the trauma and he tried to control the pain with compression dressing and ice packs while they were in the field. She was later brought to our clinic by an ambulance.\nOn physical examination, an oedema was found on the anterior surface of her thighs. The pain was continuous and aggravated on palpation of the quadriceps muscle and any knee movement. There was no gap in quadriceps continuity. Her active and passive knee flexion and extension were restricted and painful. She was not able to perform an isometric quadriceps contraction with her knee in full extension. The active knee's range of movement was 40° for the right and 55° for the left. The passive range of movement was the same because of the pain. We checked the pulse of her periphery arteries with a Doppler ultrasound machine and we found it normal. After the physical examination a roentgenogram was performed. The roentgenogram result was negative for fracture and the patella was not displaced.\nUltrasonography revealed haematoma formation on both her rectus femoris muscles, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then performed to estimate the size of the haematomas and to evaluate the surrounding soft tissues (Figure , Figure , Figure ). The diameters of the left and right haematomas within the muscles were 6 cm and 5 cm, respectively.\nBased on physical and MRI examinations the strains were classified as second grade or moderate. We examined the athlete to exclude the occurrence of compartment syndrome and we checked her coagulation profile by blood laboratory examination. We did not find any bleeding diathesis. She did not report any connective tissue disorder in her family and any use of anabolic steroids. Our patient was treated conservatively.\nThe treatment included compression bandage, ice application, and rest and elevation for the first 48 hours. Muscle relaxant drugs were administered for 1 week in maximum doses. We administered non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drugs (NSAID) on the 5th day to reduce the pain and to avoid the development of myositis ossificans. Afterwards, we applied isometric exercises and active stretching of the muscle within our patient's pain limits. She was instructed to perform active, pain-free quadriceps stretching 15 times a day and pain-free isometric quadriceps strengthening exercises. Two days later she started to walk using crutches.\nOn the 7th day our patient started stretching exercises, and she was able to walk without crutches. The active and the passive ranges of movement of her knees were bilaterally the same. The active range of movement was 110° and the passive was 120°. The three phases of treatment were rest, knee mobilization, and restoration of quadriceps function. The goals included pain-free knee flexion and extension and rapid, unrestricted return to her full athletic activities.\nSix weeks later MRI result was normal and she had regained a full pain-free range of movement (Figure , Figure ). She started training and two weeks later returned to her old sport activities and competitions. No recurrence of symptoms was observed during the follow-up examination. A follow-up radiographic examination was performed on the third and sixth month after the injury to exclude the development of myositis ossificans.","{

"A 30 year old male presented at the Surgery OPD with chief complaint of discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for 1 month. The problem started 6 months back when he underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy at another medical college for 3 days old abdominal pain. A small peptic perforation was detected and was repaired with an omental patch. On fourth post-operative day the patient developed burst abdomen. It was managed conservatively. Over a period of time the bowel got contained and the patient was put on oral nutrition. The patient was discharged was doing fine at home. However his abdominal wound was not healing. In the fourth month it was covered with the split thickness skin graft. The procedure and the post-operative period was uneventful till one month. However in the fifth month a serous discharge from the upper part of the grafted surface was noticed. It was coming from a small ulcer and was small in amount. Over a the period of time till he presented at our OPD it remained small in output. It was managed by applying gauge pieces over the wound which has to be changed once or sometimes two to three times a day.\nThe examination of the abdomen revealed a 12 cm × 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft over the middle of the abdomen. There was a small depressed ulcer of around 1 cm × 1 cm in its upper part covered with pale granulation showing serous ooze. Apart from this ulcer there were few other spots showing exuberant pale granulation (). A scar was seen at previous drain site. Palpation of the abdomen showed deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.\nThe blood reports were all but normal. Haemoglobin was 11.4 gm/dl with total WBC count as 11.6 × 103/mm3. The total serum protein was 7.9 gm/dl with serum albumin as 3.5 gm/dl. A left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm × 7 cm was seen on the ultrasound. With a suspicion of some missed pathology at previous surgery site an upper GI endoscopy was performed. A small benign looking ulcer was seen at the pylorus of the stomach.\nWith a strong suspicion of gastrocutaneous fistula, a CT fistulogram was performed. An enterocutaneous fistula between the pylorus of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall was seen. A long side branch of the fistula tract was seen communicating to a moderate sized left subphrenic collection ().\nWith confirmed diagnosis of complex gastrocutaneous fistula a repeat surgery was planned. The abdomen was entered after incising the previous scar on left lateral side and extending the incision downwards and upwards. Dense interbowel adhesions were encountered. Meticulous adhesiolysis and dissection was performed. The abscess cavity was drained and the perforation on the pylorus of the stomach was identified. It was around 1 cm × 1 cm size. Repeat omental patch repair was performed. In view of difficult dissection, feeding jejunostomy and retrograde tube duodenostomy were also made.\nAn uneventful recovery happened. He attended follow up clinic till 4 months following the discharge. There was an incisional hernia but otherwise he was doing fine. After this he was lost to follow up.\nTimeline","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Presented with fresh hemorrhagic stool'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgery': 'Anal atresia surgery and small bowel stoma as a neonate', 'RenalCondition': 'Chronic renal failure with bilateral kidney malformations'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Colonoscopy', 'Finding': 'No bleeding site detected'}, {'Test': 'Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy', 'Finding': 'No bleeding site detected'}, {'Test': 'Capsule Endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Bleeding detected in the small intestine'}, {'Test': 'Computed Tomography', 'Finding': 'Anatomy showing abnormalities in iliac arteries'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'VATER Association', 'Type': 'Congenital condition', 'Location': 'Multiple areas including sacrum, kidneys, and anal region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Transcatheter arterial embolization', 'Details': 'Selectively advanced catheter to superior mesenteric artery for gastrointestinal bleeding'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Discharged after red blood cell transfusion', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Follow-up care required for VATER Association diagnosis', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No obvious bleeding found during small intestinal resection'}}}"
"An 8-year-old male child patient presented with a swelling and pus discharge in relation to the right side of his mandible since 1 month. Past history revealed that the patient had met with a motor vehicle accident 3 months ago and was subsequently treated for fracture of the mandible on the right side. Extra oral examination revealed an obvious swelling of 1 × 1.5 cm in size on the right side of the mandibular region with the overlying skin showing a crusty appearance []. There was a sinus opening along with pus discharge over the swelling. Intra oral examination revealed inter dental wiring done from 73 till 83 []. Dental abnormalities included missing 31, rotation of 41, 42 and 32; anterior open bite and posterior open bite on the left side. Orthopantomogram revealed presence of bone plate along with 4 screws in the region of 43 and 45, which were in close approximation with the developing roots of 43 and 45 and the plate was oriented in an oblique direction []. A fracture line on the right side of the mandible extending from interdental area of 42 and 83 vertically and horizontally along the lower border of the mandible was also observed on this radiograph. There was a step deformity in the lower border of the mandible indicating improperly reduced fracture. An associated malunion of the subcondylar fracture on the left side was also noted []. Based on history, clinical features, and radiographic features this case was diagnosed as malunited fractures of the body and the condyle of the mandible on the opposite sides. Under local anesthesia the interdental wiring was removed and a crevicular incision was made from 41 till 46, thus exposing the fracture site. The screws along with bone plate were retrieved carefully []. Prophylactic extraction of 83, 84, and 85 was done to facilitate the eruption of underlying permanent teeth and to evaluate whether any damage had occurred to these teeth in the process of bone plating. Post-operative period was uneventful and after 45 days of follow-up, the extra oral swelling had subsided and the sinus was completely healed []. Intraorally and radiographically there was evidence of eruption of 44 and 43 []. There was considerable evidence of occlusal adjustment both in the anterior and posterior regions throughout the follow-up period [].","{

"A 44-year-old woman presented to the accident and emergency department with acute right knee pain. While dancing the quick-step (an energetic and form-intensive style) she externally rotated about a planted right foot and felt an acute pain in her right knee with her patella shifting laterally. On arrival at hospital her right leg was locked in full extension and she was in severe pain. The patient had no history of previous knee trauma, prior dislocations, or joint hypermobility. She has no other past medical history to suggest any cause for dislocation of the patella. In particular she had no history of paediatric lower limb alignment problems that would predispose her to a dislocated patella. On inspection of the limb there was a deformity of her right patella indicative of a rare patellar dislocation (Figures and ). The patella appeared rotated on its vertical axis and the skin over the knee joint was tented. It was fixed in position. There was a mild joint effusion and no joint line tenderness. Her range of motion at the right knee was significantly reduced with any flexion from full extension causing the patient significant pain. She was able to straight leg raise on examination indicating that her extensor mechanism was intact. The limb was otherwise neurovascularly intact. The examination of the contralateral limb was entirely normal.\nThe AP radiograph revealed a laterally dislocated patella. The lateral radiograph showed an abnormal appearance with the rotated patella impacted in the intercondylar notch of the femur (Figures and ). In the accident and emergency department one unsuccessful attempt at closed reduction was made under procedural sedation with propofol and fentanyl. The knee joint was fully extended and an attempt was made to manipulate the patella to rotate it back to its normal orientation.\nUnder a general anaesthetic with muscle relaxant the patella was successfully relocated using a closed technique. The articular surface was facing anterior laterally and it was wedged in the intercondylar notch and impacted into the lateral femoral condyle.\nKnowledge of the direction of the articular aspect was vital to the reduction method. With the patient fully muscle relaxed the knee was partially flexed to 30 degrees. Pressure was applied to the medial aspect of the articular surface of the patella that was impacted in the notch. With gentle pressure anteriorly and medially this was pushed up to clear the notch. Once free the natural tension of the extensor mechanism spontaneously reduced the patella. There was no bony injury evident on image intensifier in theatre. The knee was examined under anaesthetic. There was no evidence of any ligamentous injury. There was a normal patellar glide test in assessing for medial and lateral retinaculum damage. The orthopaedic team then conducted an immediate arthroscopy under the same general anaesthetic to check for any osteochondral damage, loose bodies, or soft tissue damage. The arthroscopy findings were of a mild haemarthrosis and mild fibrillation of the lateral trochlear cartilage and lateral patella. There was no gross osteochondral defect and no loose bodies. The medial retinaculum was assessed arthroscopically and was intact. The patient was discharged that day with straight leg immobilisation and orthopaedic followup. Two weeks following her injury she was reviewed in orthopaedic clinic with normal function in her knee. The patient will be followed up at 6 months following the injury. The injury was managed acutely and had normal arthroscopic findings; therefore further investigation with MRI was not felt to be warranted.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Bilateral hips and knee joints pain on walking', 'Progressive limitation in range of hip motion and walking ability', 'Low back pain history'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Unsuccessful closed reduction of the left hip joint at the age of 11'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Pelvic X-ray', 'Finding': 'Severe arthritis changes, dislocation on the left side, subluxation on the right side'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Severe arthritis of bilateral hip joints', 'Type': 'Degenerative joint disease', 'Location': 'Hip joints'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Cementless total hip arthroplasties', 'Details': 'Implantation of femoral and acetabular components, movement occurs between chrom-cobalt head and cross-linked polyethene liner'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient walking without crutches'}}}"
"An 18-year-old woman without a medical history showed headache and fever for a few days and then suddenly presented with personality changes with violent behavior and speech disabilities requiring her admission to the department of neurology in our hospital. A diagnostic image of her brain showed minimal changes such as mild brain edema, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocyte pleocytosis suggesting inflammatory changes. As the first presumptive diagnosis was either viral encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis, intravenous high dose steroids, acyclovir, and glycerol were administrated. Several days after her admission, she also showed involuntary movements, disturbance of consciousness, and central hypoventilation; she was managed by assisted respiration and medicated with midazolam and propofol. Since autoimmune encephalitis was the most possible diagnosis according to further examinations, plasma exchange treatment was also started, and the patient was introduced to our department for examination for a potential ovarian teratoma. Nevertheless, neither internal examination nor transvaginal ultrasonography detected an ovarian teratoma. T1-weighted pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5 × 7 mm fat intensity in the right ovary that showed the possibility of a teratoma (). T2-weighted pelvic MRI showed that a large number of similar-sized ovarian follicles surrounded the teratoma (). Initially, abdominal computed tomography (CT) with 10 mm slice thickness did not detect any fatty component in the right ovary. However, by referencing to the MRI findings, CT with 1 mm slice thickness eventually detected the fatty component in the right ovary. The mean CT number of that showed −62.5 HU (Figures and ).\nAfter 18 days from the first visit to our hospital, the patient underwent a laparoscopic operation for complete resection of the right ovarian teratoma. The macroscopic appearance of the right ovary did not show any abnormalities (). We performed a partial resection of the right ovary by removing small pieces at a time starting from the most likely location of the teratoma according to the diagnostic image (). The first resected 22 × 22 mm ovarian piece contained an intact 5 × 7 mm cystic tumor in which we macroscopically identified fat and hair components (). The pathological diagnosis was mature cystic teratoma containing component of brain tissue (Figures –).\nAn anti-NMDAR-antibody test was positive in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid 1 month after the surgery. From these results and her clinical course, the patient was diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. After the surgery, clinical findings and symptoms are gradually improving. However, the recovery of her conscious level was slow and insufficient; 50 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide in one course was administered 6 months after the operation. After 2 courses of cyclophosphamide, she showed drastic recovery, such as the complete elimination of involuntary movements and complete restoration of consciousness. Currently, while undergoing rehabilitation, she has recovered to the level of being able to ingest food by herself and walk with some help.","{

"A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures –). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed layer by layer by using 3/0 resorbable polyglaction for the facia and the subcutaneous layers and 3/0 polypropylene sutures for the skin. After the surgery, pressure bandage was applied for the edema control externally and the patient was ordered soft diet for a week. The postoperative healing was uneventful, and at the sixth month follow-up visit, ideal closure of the fistula was observed (Figures and ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Progressive, bilateral lower extremity numbness', 'Pain and tingling in feet worsens with prolonged standing and walking', 'Lower back pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PulmonarySarcoidosis': True}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI of thoracic cord', 'Finding': 'Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis'}, {'Test': 'Lumbar puncture', 'Finding': 'Negative'}, {'Test': 'Catheter angiogram', 'Finding': 'Dural arteriovenous fistula in right T7 spinal artery'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Dural arteriovenous fistula', 'Type': 'Vascular abnormality', 'Location': 'Right T7 spinal artery'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Embolization', 'Details': 'Obliteration of the fistula in right T7 spinal artery'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Without complication', 'DischargeStatus': 'Home'}}}"
"Our patient was a 67-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 1. Her past medical history included epilepsy diagnosed at 56 years of age, unspecified cardiopulmonary arrest at age 57 years, peritonitis due to acute perforated gastric ulcer, venous thrombosis of the lower limb, and pulmonary arterial embolism. She was also allergic to numerous drugs and diagnostic agents (e.g., contrast media, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and sodium valproate). She visited the department of surgery at our hospital with chief complaints of appetite loss, nausea, and vomiting that had persisted for the prior two weeks. Because abdominal plain computed tomography (CT) revealed ileus and an abdominal incisional hernia, she was immediately admitted with a diagnosis of ileus caused by the incisional hernia. Moreover, a tumor measuring 21 cm in longest diameter was detected in the pelvis (). She was thus referred to our department for detailed examination and treatment. At the initial examination, the abdomen was soft without tenderness, rebound tenderness, or muscular defense. An easily movable mass extending from the right lower abdomen to the level of the umbilicus was palpated. The patient had undergone omental implantation for acute perforated gastric ulcer 10 years earlier. Preoperative abdominal plain CT had revealed a right ovarian tumor measuring 6 cm in diameter (), which contained a part of calcification and fatty components; however, there had been no findings suggestive of malignancy, such as a solid component or a mural nodule. The right ovarian tumor was radiologically diagnosed with a mature cystic teratoma. After surgery for the acute perforated gastric ulcer, she had not been referred to the department of gynecology. No further examination of the right ovarian tumor was performed. She had not been followed up for the ovarian tumor. When the findings of abdominal plain CT performed during the current admission were compared to those of the abdominal CT obtained 10 years earlier, the ovarian tumor was noted to have grown markedly in size and to be partially solid. The CT performed during the current admission also revealed fatty components in the ovarian cyst. On the basis of these findings, malignant transformation of the mature cystic teratoma was suspected. Furthermore, pelvic plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed a cyst measuring 21 cm in longest diameter that was partially solid on the right side of the uterine body (). The solid components detected on T2-weighted images () showed high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images () and low signal intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient maps, which suggested a malignant lesion. In addition, blood tests revealed tumor marker elevations: CEA, 7.1 ng/mL (<4.9 ng/mL); CA125, 58.3 U/mL (<35 U/mL); CA19-9, 405.8 U/mL (<37 U/mL); and SCC antigen, 6.2 ng/mL (<1.5 ng/mL). Based on the clinical course, imaging findings, and elevated tumor markers, malignant transformation of the previously recognized mature cystic teratoma was strongly suspected. Sixteen days after the initial examination, semiurgent surgery was performed. While neither lymphadenopathy nor distant metastasis was detected by imaging studies, the operation consisted of abdominal bilateral adnexectomy and repair of the abdominal incisional hernia in consideration of the patient's general condition. The intraoperative findings included slight accumulation of ascites with a pink tinge due to blood and swelling of the right ovary, which was larger than a newborn's head, whereas there were no signs of capsule rupture, torsion abnormality, and so on. We detected no macroscopic abnormalities in the uterus or the left adnexa. Neither disseminated lesions nor lymphadenopathy was observed in the peritoneal cavity. The tumor in the right ovary was unilocular and weighed 2960 g, containing both fatty components and hair. Moreover, protruding lesions were observed on a portion of the tumor wall (). Cytology of ascites was negative. Histologically, cystic wall was lined by squamous epithelium and contained horny materials inside the cyst. Mature bone tissue and hair were also observed. Focally, granulation tissue was formed. Squamous cell carcinoma was found in the solid part protruding inside the cyst wall. There was a transition between squamous epithelium and squamous cell carcinoma (). The postoperative clinical diagnosis was ovarian cancer FIGO stage IA, pT1aNxM0 due to malignant transformation of a mature cystic teratoma which had first been noted 10 years earlier. Given the history of allergy to multiple drugs, cardiopulmonary arrest, venous thrombosis of the lower limb, and pulmonary arterial embolism, postoperative chemotherapy was not planned. As of two years since surgery, no recurrence has been observed.","{

"A 33-year-old Caucasian male of Greek origin sustained a work accident. He fell from a height of 2 meters and landed on his right side. On admission he was conscious and well orientated with normal vital signs. His right shoulder and arm were painful, swollen and deformed. Clinical examination revealed a closed and neurovascular intact injury that had resulted to angulation of the arm with loss of the normal contour of the shoulder.\nRadiographs showed an anterior dislocation of the shoulder with a transverse fracture of the middle third of the humeral shaft on the same side (Figure ). The arm was temporarily immobilized in a plaster slab. We have not performed a Magnetic Resonance scan (MRI) in order to investigate possible rotator cuff pathology, because of the lack of MRI equipment in our hospital. Thus, we decided that clinical examination at later would indicate the need or not of MRI. As soon as the secondary clinical survey was completed the patient was carried to the operating theatre. Under general anaesthesia, repeated attempts for closed reduction of the dislocated shoulder failed. Strong muscle contraction, despite the induction of muscle relaxation agents by the anesthetists, and extensive swelling of the soft tissues were obstructive of a successful reduction. Because of the unstable state of the fractured humerus and the risk for further soft tissue compromise and iatrogenic neurovascular damage, it was decided not to insist on reduction maneuvers. The surgeons preferred to attempt stabilization of the shaft fracture by intramedullary nailing prior to the reduction. Under fluoroscopy the entry point was targeted on the dislocated humeral head and an incision was made on the overlying skin. Although the anatomy of the region was altered, because of the dislocation, the anteriorly placed humeral head in the subcoracoid space facilitated, rather than obstructed, the guide wire and nail insertion. Intraoperative investigation revealed no rotator cuff or biceps pathology. Unfortunately a typical intramedullary nailing procedure could not be completed because after the proximal locking screw insertion, the image intensifier equipment suffered serious damage. The weakness for targeted distal locking which would subsequently result to rotational instability and the perspective of reduction manipulations, once the fixation was concluded, implemented the use of a rotational stability providing alternative. Thus a four holes small antirotational plate was placed on the anterior cortex over the fracture site. Four screws (2 at each side of the fracture) were inserted just medial to the nail. All screws were cortical and engaged both the anterior and posterior cortex of the bone enhancing the fixation and securing rotational stability. The shoulder was then reduced by gentle manipulation which sequentially included: external rotation, mild traction and inwards placement of the head into the glenohumeral joint (Figure ).\nThe limb was immobilized in a sling and only occasional flexion-extension of the elbow was allowed. Three weeks postoperatively the patient was encouraged to start Range of Motion (ROM) and muscle strengthening exercises of the shoulder. Bone union was demonstrated radiographically four months postoperatively (Figure ). Mild pain and restriction of shoulder abduction over 90 degrees were demonstrated, due to the impingement of the proud nail in the subacromial space. Therefore, 12 months after the operation and since bone union was secured, both nail and plate were removed. After the hardware removal, the pain symptoms drastically subsided. Full muscular strength and normal ROM were regained. The patient returned to his daily routine activities. At 3 years follow-up, the patient's shoulder is painless and retains a full range of motion (Figure ). No signs of shoulder osteoarthritic lesions or calcific tendonitis are evident in the latest radiographs.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Incidental finding of giant left ICA aneurysm on MRI scan during workup for headaches', 'No history of thunderclap headache or associated visual/neurological symptoms'], 'MedicalHistory': {'None': 'No significant medical history reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Initial angiogram', 'Finding': 'Large left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm measuring 26×19 mm with a wide neck of 14 mm'}, {'Test': 'Balloon occlusion test', 'Finding': 'Negative for neurological change during 20 minutes of occlusion'}, {'Test': 'Follow-up angiogram', 'Finding': 'Persistent filling of left ICA aneurysm in retrograde fashion through PCOM artery'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Giant left ICA aneurysm', 'Type': 'Intracranial aneurysm', 'Location': 'Para-ophthalmic region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Flow diverter stent placement', 'Details': 'Stent placed across PCOM artery into distal left ICA'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient recovered well with no neurological deficits or post-operative complications', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Complete occlusion of aneurysm with patent flow in PCOM artery'}}}"
"A 31-year-old male patient was referred from the department of plastic surgery for the fabrication of an auricular prosthesis for his missing right side ear. The ear was lost as a consequence of a road traffic accident a few years ago. The patient was initially attempted for surgical reconstructing of the artificial ear using cartilage and alloplastic graft materials. As the reconstruction did not provide pleasing esthetics, it was later removed, and the patient was referred for prosthetic replacement of the missing ear. After due examination and obtaining patient's informed consent, two implants' supported custom silicone auricular prosthesis was agreed upon as the best treatment modality for the patient. Presurgical cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were made with a radiographic stent with radio-opaque markers in different probable implant positions. The scans were used to assess the proximity of dura, sigmoid sinuses, and any other limiting anatomical structure from the planned implant positions. The same radiographic stent was modified and converted into a surgical stent to conform to the planned implant sites. Two dental implants were placed at sites 11:30 and 9:30 o'clock positions at approximately 20 mm distance from the center of the external auditory meatus.[] Thinning out of the basal tissue bed was also carried out in the same surgical appointment taking into consideration the presence of residual graft material from the previous reconstruction procedure lying in the tissue bed. The implants were left to heal for 3 months. Despite the attempted thinning of the tissue bed, fresh CBCT scans revealed the tissue thickness from the top of the implant surface to the external skin surface to be in the range of 7–11 mm over both the implants at various sites []. Only custom made healing abutment of a height higher than 11 mm could prove useful in maintaining the patency of the passage from the external skin surface to the implant chamber and prevent tissues from sagging in as they heal postsurgical exposure. In this scenario, where uncertainty prevailed with regards to obtaining precise custom healing abutments to suit the clinical requirements, CBCT DICOM (.dcm) files were converted into standard tessellation language using a software (Mimics Innovation Suite 17, Materialise, Technologielaan, Leuven, Belgium). 12 mm long healing abutments were designed using CAD [Figures and ] and were then milled (CAM) in PEEK material. The healing abutments were sterilized, and readied for connection to the fixture well before the patient was scheduled for the second stage implant exposure [Figures and ]. No adverse reaction like purulent discharge, severe pain, swelling, or any other sign of periimplantitis was encountered during the entire follow-up period of 4 weeks with PEEK abutments []. The patient was taken up in the conventional manner of impressions and technique to fabricate a titanium bar framework to support a silicone auricular prosthesis over the implants [Figures -].","{

"A 79-year-old right-handed male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease underwent the EVAR procedure with a left renal stent for an incidental finding of a juxtarenal AAA on CT scan (). According to the vascular surgery operative report, the procedure was completed successfully through access of the bilateral femoral arteries and the left brachial artery (). After the procedure, there was no immediate recognition of any major complications other than a small contained hematoma at the brachial catheter insertion site that formed after withdrawal of the catheter.\nThe patient then presented to our outpatient pain management clinic 2 months following the procedure with symptoms of atrophy and weakness of the left forearm and pain in the left hand. During the initial examination, a pulsatile mass of 2–4 cm was palpated in the medial left upper arm in the antecubital fossa. Motor assessment of the upper extremities revealed bilateral biceps flexion/extension 4/5, left finger flexion 2/5, and left hand grip 2/5. The patient's presentation was concerning for an aneurysm of the left brachial artery. An immediate ultrasound of the left upper extremity was ordered and revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the left brachial artery. The patient was urgently referred to vascular surgery and was taken to the operating room to repair the pseudoaneurysm the following day.\nFour months after repair of the pseudoaneurysm, the patient returned to our clinic and his left upper extremity sequelae worsened. He now demonstrated significant guarding of his left hand and allodynia to the median nerve distribution and had skin changes and contracture of his digits with significant weakness and atrophy. An X-ray of the hand demonstrated significant osteopenia. A diagnosis of CRPS type II was established. The patient was referred for conservative treatment, which included but was not limited to pharmacologic intervention, occupational therapy for desensitization, and stellate ganglion blocks. The patient failed these conservative treatment measures, and 3 months after diagnosis he died as a result of sequelae from a respiratory infection unrelated to the current case.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chronic left hip and groin pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI of the hip and femur', 'Finding': 'Distention of the left common and external iliac veins with associated deep vein thrombosis'}, {'Test': 'MR angiogram and venogram', 'Finding': 'Significant narrowing of the upper aspect of the left common iliac vein with iliac vein compression'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Iliac vein compression syndrome', 'Type': 'Vascular condition', 'Location': 'Left common iliac vein'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Iliac vein stenting', 'Details': 'Deployment of a Nitinol self-expanding stent across the stenosis with good restoration on angiography'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient did well after treatment', 'DischargeStatus': 'No further complications'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Continues regular training', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No symptoms reported'}}}"
"A 19-year-old male with a history of a right tibial stress fracture with intramedullary nail fixation 14 months before presented to the emergency department after jumping into a shallow lake and immediately suffering severe right ankle pain and inability to bear weight. He had had the proximal intramedullary nail screw removed 3 months prior to presentation due to discomfort but reported no other medical problems. On exam, there was significant swelling of the ankle, with global tenderness to palpation. The fibula was noted to be displaced, as palpation of the lateral aspect of the ankle resulted in contact with the tibia, and palpation at the normal region of the peroneal groove revealed the distal fibula. Motion of the ankle was limited in all planes; however, the foot was neurovascularly intact and sensitive to light touch. A 3-view X-ray of the ankle confirmed the dislocation of the fibula posterior to the tibia and posterior dislocation of the talus, while showing the stable intramedullary nail and distal screw with no apparent lucencies (). Additionally, AP and lateral views of the entire tibia and fibula did not reveal any fractures, and the patient did not complain of any discomfort or tenderness to palpation outside of the ankle. Closed reduction was attempted in the emergency department; the talus was relocated, but the fibula was lodged in place and unable to be reduced. Understanding that repeated attempts at closed reduction most likely be unsuccessful and to minimize the risk of articular damage, iatrogenic fracture, or skin breakdown, the decision was made to proceed with open reduction. The patient consented to open reduction and internal fixation of the fibular dislocation and was taken to the operating room the same day. The time that elapsed from injury to operation start was just under 5 hours. From the time the patient had been seen in the emergency department to operation start was under 3 hours. A lateral incision was made, and the fibula was exposed, positioned behind the tibia. At this point, a hemostat was placed between the fibula and tibia and used as a lever to free the fibula. The fibula was reduced in an open fashion but noted to be unstable due to syndesmotic ligament disruption. The fibula was then held in place with a Kirschner wire and fixed by placing two quadricortical screws through the tibia, using radiographic guidance to avoid the previously placed nail and remaining distal screw (). Following this, the syndesmosis was noted to be stable, and the incision was irrigated and closed. At 3 months postoperatively, the fixation continued to remain stable (). The patient underwent removal of the syndesmotic screws 4 months postoperatively, and at 6 months from the initial injury, the patient reported mild pain with activity and had full strength but was limited to approximately 10 degrees of plantar flexion. His AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot score was noted to be 85.","{

"A 48-year-old female patient (gravid 3, para 1) visited the private hospital because of urinary incontinence and lower abdominal discomfort. On the abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, heterogeneously enhanced mass measuring 8 cm in size nearby the uterus and right ovary was not detected exactly. CT finding suggested the highly possibility of right adnexal tumor. The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration for treatment of this tumor. However, there was no definite abnormality on both adnexae and uterus grossly and the retroperitoneal mass on right side of uterus was detected in the operative field. The patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation and definitive treatment of right retroperitoneal pelvic mass. She had no previous medical illness except surgical history of appendectomy 22 years ago. Abdominal and vaginal examination revealed non-specific findings without palpation of abdominal mass and the laboratory findings are within normal limit including tumor marker.\nAbdominal ultrasonography revealed the right adnexal mass with echogenicity and this mass was abutting to uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated 8 cm-sized, enhancing mass attached to right adnexa and the uterus. This mass had the low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous, high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (). Because the previous laparoscopic exploration was negative for abnormality of right ovary, the ovarian tumor was excluded on diagnosis of the patient. Other possible diagnosis on MRI finding was mesenchymal sarcoma because the tumor had similar intensity to the muscle of uterus meaning originated from muscle but it looked like as separate from the uterus. Based on the imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed preoperatively as mesenchymal sarcoma on pelvic cavity and exploratory laparotomy was planned for removal the pelvic mass.\nAfter laparotomy via lower midline incision, the careful examination of pelvic cavity was performed. On the operative fields, the uterus was found to be normal size with smooth contour and there was no abnormal finding on both ovaries and fallopian tubes (). The retroperitoneal tumor of size 8 × 6 cm was palpated beneath the right broad ligament of uterus and was exposed during the opening of the broad ligament (). After the exposure the retroperitoneal space, careful dissection of the tumor was performed from adjacent organs including uterus and right iliac vessels and the retroperitoneal tumor was excised completely (). This tumor was attached to the right surface of uterus without any connection of uterus except the thin fibrous membrane. However, neither invasion nor adhesion to adjacent organs was observed.\nOn the gross findings, the tumor was well-encapsulated and contained some part of myxoid degeneration (). Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the intersecting fascicles of spindle cells (). The immunohistochemical staining was positive for actin, desmin, estrogen receptor (ER) & progesterone receptor (PR) and negative for alphainhibin and S-100 protein ().

"A 43 year old male visited the clinic complaining about the discomfort and pain in the upper right molar area while biting. The clinical and radiographic examination revealed that the maxillary right second premolar and the maxillary right first molar were both associated with localized severe chronic periodontitis. In contrast, the maxillary right second molar had healthy condition without an opposing tooth ( and ). Considering the financial difficulty of the patient, autotransplantation was preferred to implant installation. Following consultation with a periodontist, the maxillary right second molar was planned to be transplanted to maxillary right first molar space and periodontal treatment was planned after that.\nScaling and root planning was performed at 1 month before autotransplantation. Due to the trismus of the patient, root canal therapy was performed after the surgery. Surgical procedure was similar to that described for case 1. Under local anesthesia, the maxillary right first molar was extracted. The recipient site was prepared with a round bur and a duplicated tooth model. The maxillary right second molar was extracted and immediately placed into the recipient site. It was stabilized with 4-0 silk sutures and a semi-rigid resin wire splint (). The extra-oral time from extraction of the maxillary right second molar to transplantation was 11 minutes. Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day and Ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day were prescribed for a week, and a 0.1% chlorhexidine rinse was used for 7 days.\nThe root canal therapy was begun 2 weeks later. After the calcium hydroxide dressing was maintained for 2 weeks, root canal therapy was completed at 4 weeks after the surgery.\nAt the 7 month follow up, there was no clinical symptom or radiographic signs of root resorption (). As planned, the regenerative periodontal surgery was done on the maxillary right second premolar which had deep periodontal pocket. A new bone formation around the bifurcation area of the transplanted tooth was confirmed during the surgery (). The autotransplanted tooth will be restored with a full crown. At the 18 month follow up, the transplanted tooth had a normal periodontal pocket depth and no mobility.","{

"A 22-year-old woman, gravid 2, para 1-0-0-1, was referred to our institution for fetal echocardiography at 23 weeks of gestation because of abnormally looking great arterial arches. The pregnancy had not been complicated. The mother had not had any diseases or taken any drugs or herbal medications. There was no family history of congenital heart disease. Obstetric evaluation showed normal fetal growth, normal amount of amniotic fluid and normal placenta. The fetal echocardiography revealed the normal four chamber view, where two atria and two ventricles were normal in size and thickness (). The two atrioventricular valves moved normally. Two great arteries arose normally from the appropriate ventricles. The pulmonary and aortic valves looked normal and the size of the main pulmonary artery and aortic root was within normal limits. The aortic arch was normal in size and in location, but the ductal arch was not visualized in any views. The main pulmonary artery bifurcated into two branch pulmonary arteries but was not continuous with the DA (). However color Doppler examination showed a tortuous 'S' shaped ductus cuddled inside the aortic arch (). The DA joined the descending aorta with an obtuse angle and showed a flow signal from the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta (). Color aliasing occurred along the course of the ductus but pulsed Doppler measurement of velocity was not attempted because of the poor angle of insonation. Flow velocity and waveforms of the two great arteries were within normal limits and no TR was found. A diagnosis of S-shaped DA with mild narrowing was made and follow up examination was arranged.\nA repeat examination was performed at 27 weeks of gestation and showed nearly the same findings as before. The RV was normal in size and thickness and no TR was noted. Because the DA was S-shaped, it was very difficult to assess size along the whole range of the DA. However, the color Doppler examination showed tortuous turbulent flow in the ductus and suggested mild obstruction. The sagittal section of the aortic arch showed a ductal junction through which low velocity forward flow from the DA to the descending aorta was noted. Obstetric evaluation showed that fetal growth was appropriate and the amniotic fluid index was adequate. No signs of hydrops were noted.\nThe third examination was performed at 33 weeks of gestation. The right atrium was big and the RV was hypertrophied and globular in shape. The intracavitary volume of the RV looked slightly smaller than normal because of the thick ventricular wall and hypertrophy of the trabeculations. The right ventricular endocardial lining and the chordae of the tricuspid valve were very bright (). Color Doppler examination showed moderate TR and its velocity was 4.5 m/sec (). Every attempt failed to demonstrate any flow through the ductus. In spite of the right ventricular overload, fetal growth was within normal range and there was no evidence of fetal hydrops.\nAfter a discussion, we decided to deliver the baby. A female infant weighing 2625 g was born at 34 weeks gestation by induced delivery. Apgar scores were 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes. Symptoms and signs immediately after birth were tachypnea, chest retraction, grunting sound and low oxygen saturation. An echocardiography performed at 20 minutes after birth showed a small hypertrophied RV and increased echogenicity of the moderator band and chordae of tricuspid valve (). There was a moderate TR with a velocity of 3.7 m/sec (). The short axis view showed a hypertrophied RV (). The ductus was searched for but no ductus was found in 2-D and color images (). Shunt flow through the foramen ovale was mainly right to left (). She required respiratory support with a mechanical ventilator for the first 3 days. She was successfully weaned from the ventilator on her fourth day and discharged at 12 days old. Follow-up examination at the outpatient clinic showed that she did not have any cardiac symptoms or signs. Echocardiography taken at 2 months of age showed much improvement. The RV was nearly normal in size and thickness. Increased echogenicity of the RV was also nearly normalized. There remained TR with a velocity of 3.0 m/sec. At 7 months of age, all echocardiographic findings returned to normal with resolution of TR.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe chest pain', 'Shortness of breath'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Road traffic accident with severe head injury and pelvic fracture'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT chest with intravenous contrast', 'Finding': 'Large aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta causing compression on the left main bronchus and pulmonary arteries'}, {'Test': 'Postoperative routine chest X-ray', 'Finding': 'Complete collapse of the left lung'}, {'Test': 'Urgent CT chest with intravenous contrast', 'Finding': 'Endovascular stent in place, aneurysmal sac occluding left main bronchus and compressing right main pulmonary artery'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Thoracic aortic aneurysm causing compression on adjacent structures', 'Type': 'Vascular condition', 'Location': 'Descending thoracic aorta'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Endoluminal thoracic aortic stenting', 'Details': 'Stent placed to relieve compression on left main bronchus and pulmonary arteries'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Gradual improvement in lung expansion', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on 15th post-op day with complete expansion of left lung'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Fifteen months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Remained asymptomatic during regular outpatient follow-up'}}}"
"We report the case of an 85-year-old healthy Caucasian man suffering from severe neck pain and headache for years with aggravation and a change in pain character since 2 months. On presentation at our department, he described his symptoms as constant boring pain not being altered by activity or rest whereas increasing at night and in the early morning. Physical exam showed a painful and restricted cervical spine motion. No sensory and motor deficits in the upper limbs were noted. General physical examination and laboratory investigations were normal. Past medical history revealed a heart attack 28 years ago and a 40 pack-year history of cigarette smoking. No regular medications were taken. He presented recent X-ray pictures showing a multi-level degeneration of cervical spine and 7-months-old MRI images showing cervical disc protrusion C4 to C7 and neuroforaminal stenosis with compression of the C6 nerve root considered to be the reason for his pain. As conservative treatment was ineffective, performance of spondylodesis and spinal decompression C5 - C7 was advised.\nA neurological examination and a closer look at the patient's detailed pain history revealed that the abovementioned complaints could not be completely explained by the spinal stenosis. Therefore, new MRI scan was requested. An osteolysis of the odontoid process highly suspicious for metastasis was seen. CT scan of the cervical spine confirmed no compromise of odontoid process stability so that a pathologic fracture of the vertebra with possible severe consequences for the patient was not expected. Complete tumor staging with abdominal and thoracic CT scans and skeleton scintigraphy was performed. A coin lesion suspicious of bronchial carcinoma in the right lung and further pancreatic and adrenal lesions consistent with metastases were discovered. Further bony metastases could not be revealed. The histological examination of the tissue obtained in bronchoscopy displayed dense infiltrates of a large cell undifferentiated carcinoma in the right upper pulmonary lobe. Following the decision of the interdisciplinary tumor board, the patient was treated with palliative radiochemotherapy. This alleviated the patient's neck pain and headache. He was discharged from hospital on his request and died 14 weeks later in a hospice.","{

"We report on a case of a 68 year-old healthy female who initially presented to the emergency room with pain, redness, and swelling in the regions surrounding the proximal and radial aspect of the nail fold of her right thumb in May of 2009. She noted that she had worsening symptoms over the course of one week but no prior history of similar events. The patient denied any trauma to the digit. She underwent an incision and drainage of what was diagnosed clinically as a paronychia. Cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus and she received IV antibiotics. The patient was discharged in stable condition with resolution of her symptoms.\nShe then presented four months later with pain along the radial aspect of her thumb with scant serous drainage from the lateral nail fold. She also pointed out the presence of a small amount of granulomatous tissue, which was subsequently resolved. She was followed conservatively and the drainage ceased. She continued to note occasional pain in the radial aspect of her nail fold as well as the interphalangeal joint. At this time, she was found to have what appeared to be a nail deformity (). The patient was taken to the operating room for a biopsy. The biopsy specimen was notable for moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma as well as pyogenic granuloma.\nThe cells showed nuclear pleomorphism, atypia, with increased abnormal mitoses and areas of keratin formation. The patient subsequently underwent re-excision of the nail bed, nail fold, and bone in the biopsy area with local flap reconstruction. Margins of the resection were measured 5 mm from the biopsy incision.\nTwo focal areas of squamous cell carcinoma were noted in the bony segment on final pathology (~). The patient subsequently returned to the operating room for an amputation at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. Due to the level of bony involvement, the patient underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, which was negative for malignancy.\nWe employed the 7500 Real Time PCR system from Applied Biosystems for evaluation for the presence of human papillomavirus. DNA extracted from the specimen was probed for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA isotypes 16 and 18. Neither HPV type 16 nor HPV type 18 was detected by Real time PCR. In order to further identify the presence of additional HPV isotypes, we utilized a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for detection of fourteen high-risk HPV types through a pooled probe. The sample from total DNA extracted from tissue sections demonstrated a positive reaction only with HPV oligomix group 2, which includes oligonucleotides with target-specific affinity to HPV types 18, 39, 45, 59 and 68. Thus, at least one HPV isotype in our patient's specimen was positive.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe acute upper abdominal pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': True, 'DiabetesMellitus': True, 'CoronaryHeartDisease': True, 'AtrialFibrillation': True, 'ChronicObstructivePulmonaryDisease': True, 'PreviousSurgery': 'Omphalocele repair', 'PancreaticCystadenoma': {'DiagnosisMethod': ['CT scan', 'MRI', 'EUS', 'FNA', 'Serology', 'Blood test screening'], 'FollowUp': {'RegularFollowUpPeriod': 'Six years', 'LastFollowUp': 'Four years ago'}}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest and abdominal x-rays', 'Finding': 'Inconclusive'}, {'Test': 'Intravenous contrast CT scan', 'Finding': {'FreePeritonealAir': True, 'FreeFluid': True, 'LargeMassFromStomach': True, 'SecondaryLiverLesions': True}}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Pancreatic serous microcystic adenoma', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Pancreas with hepatic metastasis'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Laparotomy', 'Details': 'Surgical suture of prepyloric ulcer perforation, liver biopsy, stomach perforation closure, washout'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Recovered from surgery in 10 days', 'DischargeStatus': 'Died a month later due to other unrelated medical problems'}}}"
"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old female presented to our emergency department with complaints of acute onset of epigastric pain and nausea with bilious emesis. Workup in the way of liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound did not demonstrate evidence suggesting biliary or gallbladder pathology, and as such she was discharged home. She represented within hours of discharge due to worsening symptoms. She therefore underwent evaluation with a computed tomography that demonstrated a soft tissue mass located posterior to the gallbladder (). The patient then underwent further evaluation with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Again, a complex cystic structure of indeterminate etiology was observed at the porta hepatis without evidence of communication with either the biliary or vascular structures. At the time, the differential diagnosis included a ruptured hepatic adenoma, biliary cystic lesion, or enteric cyst.\nSecondary to these findings and her persistent symptoms the patient was taken to the operating room. At the time of laparoscopy a hemorrhagic pedunculated mass was identified attached to the infundibulum of the gallbladder once the fundus was retracted in a cephalad direction (). It was easily dissected off the hilar structures by blunt dissection and then resected by ligating a small pedicle of tissue connecting this mass to the gallbladder infundibulum near the cystic duct by using a harmonic scalpel. There was also a considerable amount of inflammation to the infundibulum of the gallbladder in proximity to this hemorrhagic mass with the remainder appearing normal. Therefore, a cholecystectomy was performed as well. We believe the cholecystitis was secondary to inflammation from the hemorrhagic mass. As mentioned previously, her initial ultrasound did not show any evidence of cholecystitis. Even though one could expect this inflammation to resolve once the hemorrhagic mass was removed, we decided to perform a cholecystectomy because there was considerable dissection within the region of the cystic duct and the concern of potential ischemia and stricture did exist.\nThe patient's postoperative course was uneventful and her symptoms resolved immediately. She was discharged home on the first postoperative day and was asymptomatic when seen in follow-up.\nGross pathology of the hilar mass revealed a 1.2 × 2.8 × 4.5 cm firm purple ovoid structure. Histology revealed extensive hemorrhagic necrosis in the background of normal liver parenchyma. The presence of hepatic lobules with central veins and organized portal structures ruled out adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia (). Therefore, the final diagnosis was that of a hemorrhagic benign ectopic liver tissue. Histologic evaluation of the gallbladder demonstrated localized cholecystitis in the area adjacent to the mass.","{

"A 62-year-old female presented for evaluation of recurrent left lower extremity swelling. Her medical history was notable for prior deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She denied the active use of HRT and tobacco use during this admission. Venous Doppler ultrasound completed in the emergency room revealed extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending superiorly towards the left common iliac vein. Further imaging with ultrasound revealed compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery as well as a significantly elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein (14.2 seconds) suggestive of MTS. The patient was taken to the operating suite and during the procedure the common iliac vein appeared normal distally, but more proximally the vein was narrowed significantly to a diameter of less than 2 mm. Prior to entering the inferior vena cava, the common iliac vein normalized. Using intravenous ultrasound, measurements were taken and a 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent was deployed at the area of stenosis. The stent was noted to have migrated upward into the inferior vena cava and a buttressing of this stent with a 16 x 40 mm Wallstent was placed to ensure adequate apposition. Unfortunately, this caused further migration upward into the IVC and a 14 mm Atlas balloon was used to help secure the migrated IVC stent. The area of stenosis was no longer stented given this migration. Therefore, stenting of the left common iliac vein stenosis was ultimately achieved with a 14 x 80 mm Luminexx stent (). The patient was started on warfarin with heparin bridging postoperatively. Early ambulation and the routine use of elastic stockings were encouraged following the procedure. The following day the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and an abdominal x-ray revealed only two stents located in the abdomen (). A chest x-ray was obtained and revealed the initial 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent projecting over the right atrium (). She underwent open-heart surgery for stent retrieval and had a postoperative course complicated by atrial fibrillation and recurrent left sided lower extremity DVT managed with catheter directed thrombolysis. Hypercoagulable work-up revealed homozygosity of the Factor V Leiden gene mutation. One week after discharge, she developed hypotension and lightheadedness. She presented to the emergency department and was found to have pericardial tamponade requiring blood transfusion, pericardiocentesis, and pericardial window. Anticoagulation treatment was stopped during hospital stay and not resumed upon discharge.\nThree weeks later, she had a syncopal episode secondary to a massive pulmonary embolus (PE). Imaging also revealed residual DVT in bilateral lower extremities. She underwent thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator and subsequently developed a thoracic hematoma. Given the residual clot burden in the bilateral lower extremity, she underwent IVC filter placement and mechanical thrombectomy. No additional stents were placed. Throughout the hospitalization the patient required multiple blood products after developing a hematoma related to recent thoracic surgery. The patient was eventually stabilized and given the Factor V Leiden mutation and life-threatening PE, she was started on rivaroxaban indefinitely. Since these events, she has been followed closely as an outpatient with no known hospitalizations related to bleeding or thrombosis. At 5-year follow-up, the patient reports that she is doing well. She is not experiencing any complications related to rivaroxaban. She does have residual postthrombotic syndrome (CEAP class 3, Villalta Score 8) well managed with daily compression stockings.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Painless swelling in the volar aspect of right mid forearm for 10 years', 'Increase in size of swelling associated with pain for the past two years', 'Pain and paresthesia in median nerve distribution of right hand'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Mass found to be subcutaneous, limited, and homogeneous measuring 6 cm in diameter'}, {'Test': 'Histopathological examination', 'Finding': 'Schwannoma with presence of spindle cells forming Verocay bodies and Antony A and B areas identified'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Schwannoma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Median nerve in right mid forearm'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Excision of the tumor', 'Details': 'Tumour found to be well encapsulated and arising from the median nerve in the right mid forearm.

"A 33-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to our department in the 16th week of her first gestation because of suspicion during a routine ultrasound of decreased fetal movements and fetal malformation consisting of postural deformity of both lower limbs associated with a uterine fibroid. The family history was unremarkable and the mother's medical history nonsignificant except for the presence of two intramural uterine myomas diagnosed before the current pregnancy and smaller than 47 mm in maximum diameter in previous control one year before gestation.\nOur ultrasound investigation verified the presence of an intramural-submucosal tumor with a muscular echogenic pattern and a size of 110 × 88 mm in the anterior uterine wall near to the internal cervical os and another intramural one with a size of 28 × 21 mm in the uterine fundus. Fetus presented a normal heart rate pattern and was observed with absent movements and displaced to the right uterine wall in an abnormal position, with hyperextension of head and strongly flexed lower limbs (). Fetal measures according to the gestational age and the amount of amniotic fluid were normal. On the basis of these findings, the diagnosis of arthrogryposis secondary to fetal akinesia due to giant leiomyoma was done.\nAccording to the Spanish legislation, the parents decided the elective termination of pregnancy. A vaginal delivery was induced with local prostaglandins without complications. At the time of birth, the fetus had not cardiac activity and showed external male genitals, a weight of 105 g and a length of 125 mm. His position consisted of internal rotation of the shoulders and stiffness of the limbs with symmetrically flexed and fixed elbows and wrists and severe equinovarus deformities of the feet ().\nThe pathology report concluded that internal organs of the fetus did not present abnormalities. Histopathological examination reported extraconnective tissue developed around the joints and tissue between the muscle fibers swollen with the presence of red blood cells. Chromosomal analysis was normal and the study of fetal DNA excluded the spinal muscular atrophy because there were no deletions of the SMN1 gene.","{

After one year of injury, the patient was operated at another centre wherein anterior C5 cervical corpectomy with mesh cage, bone grafting, and anterior cervical plating was done.\nAfter surgery, although neurological status of the patient remained the same but was otherwise doing well, only to return after 1.5 months of primary surgery with mild neck pain which was insidious in onset, non-progressive in nature, aggravated by activity and relieved with rest with no diurnal variation and no associated systemic symptoms. An radiograph of the cervical spine done within three days of neck pain showed loosening and back out of upper screws of the anterior cervical plate (). A total of 2.5 months after the primary surgery, there was sudden onset difficulty in swallowing, more for solid foods with associated pain in the throat. There was no history suggestive of trauma, fever, respiratory difficulty, local swelling or wound discharge. The symptoms progressed for the next 2 to 3 days after which dysphagia resolved. However, odynophagia persisted to some extent and gradually resolved in the next 2-3 weeks. Repeat radiograph of the cervical spine immediately after throat pain showed that one of the proximal screws was missing along with completely backed out plate (). The patient was immediately immobilized with rigid cervical collar and was instructed to avoid gross neck movements to restrict further backing out of screws.\nA careful search for the missing screw was done by chest radiograph and CT chest where it was not found, followed by abdominal radiograph () and CT abdomen () which finally revealed the screw in the abdomen.\nUpper GI endoscopy was done to look for status of the upper GI tract. As screw had reached the colon and showed gradual movement on serial abdominal radiographs, we waited for its spontaneous expulsion with feces but it showed no significant movement over next 10 days and remained stuck to a single place on right side of colon which warranted colonoscopic removal to avoid perforation of the colon. On colonoscopic examination and screw removal, there was an evident erosion of superficial mucosa without any perforation of colon.\nAfter screw removal from colon, patient was planned for plate removal in view of possible irritation to surrounding structures including esophagus and additional posterior stabilization to maintain alignment of cervical spine. Anteriorly via Smith Robinson approach, the plate and screws were removed. As initial surgery was done on the left side with right sided screw migrating down the colon, we preferred the right side approach for repeat surgery so that pharyngeophageal perforation could be better examined from the right side. While removing, it was found that distal screws were holding well and bone strength seemed good. Pharynx showed healing perforation while the proximal portion of esophagus was also examined properly and could not find any erosion or perforation. Mesh cage was found snugly fit with fusion taking place between C4-C6. Posterior surgery was done by Bohlman’s interspinous wiring. Postoperatively patient was rehabilitated. Presently, patient is self-voiding, independent walker with the help of a stick and able to carry most of his activities of daily living. Patient was evaluated using JOA score (Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score) with Pre-operative score of 8/17 which improved to 13/17 at final follow-up of 1.5 years.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe chest and back pain following motor vehicle accident'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant past injuries reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest X-ray', 'Finding': 'Multiple rib fractures, mediastinal widening, and left pleural effusion'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Contained ruptured aortic rupture below the isthmus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Contained ruptured aortic rupture', 'Type': 'Traumatic', 'Location': 'Below the isthmus'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Open surgical repair', 'Details': 'Synthetic polyester Dacron tube interposition graft sewn with No 5-0 polypropylene suture'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient weaned off left heart bypass and responded well', 'DischargeStatus': 'Satisfactory'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Two years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Regular follow-up with satisfactory results'}}}"
"This is the case of a two-year-old boy who was referred to our Emergency Department by his pediatric cardiologist for evaluation of his lung condition. The physician was performing a routine echocardiogram for the assessment of the child's preexistent foramen ovale, when he saw a round opacity in the thorax, suspicious of a foreign body. This finding necessitated further evaluation by a chest radiograph.\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable upon arrival and not in distress. He had normal oxygen saturation and a normal head and neck examination. Examination of the lungs revealed mild crackles over lung bases but with no evidence of stridor or hoarseness.\nUpon questioning, the mother reported that he had been having vague upper respiratory symptoms with food regurgitation and frequent vomiting over the past seven months. She denied solid food dysphagia but reported mild daily drooling. These symptoms were progressively worsening over the past four months. He was initially diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease and treated with prokinetics and proton pump inhibitors, to which he responded only minimally.\nA chest radiograph was done in the emergency room showing the presence of a round metallic density over the topography of the upper esophagus showing irregular contour, with mild mass effect on the left aspect of the trachea (). The lung fields appeared clear. Further evaluation by a CT scan showed the same round metallic object at the level of the upper esophagus (). A barium swallow was performed and showed that the patient was swallowing without difficulty, with the foreign body apparently separate from the esophageal tract.\nThe decision was made to perform an esophagoscopy in the operating room to the attempt of foreign body removal. Intraoperatively, the foreign body was not seen but a hard mass was felt at the lateral esophageal wall, which was covered by granulation tissue. Multiple attempts to remove the foreign body were performed but unsuccessful. The decision was made to abort the surgery and proceed with an external approach and the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit.\nTwo days later, the patient was scheduled for a right posterolateral thoracotomy and an extrapleural approach for removal of foreign body with esophagostomy and esophagoplasty. The surgery was successful and was followed by a smooth uncomplicated course. The foreign body retrieved was a button battery.\nForeign body ingestion is a frequently occurring problem in pediatric age groups with 75% occurring at ages less than 4 years []. Esophageal foreign body impaction (EFBI) is a rare presenting pediatric complaint due to the fact that not all are present immediately following ingestion. The majority of ingested foreign bodies pass through the GI tract with no sequelae; however, those that do cause impaction do so in the upper esophagus, the most common site accounting for more than 75% of all cases [, ].\nThe presenting symptoms can range from being completely asymptomatic to being fatal. In between these ends of the spectrum, symptoms can include GI complaints including vomiting, drooling, dysphagia, odynophagia, and respiratory complaints such as cough, stridor, and choking [, , ]. However, neither the symptoms upon presentation nor the location of impaction within the esophagus is predictive of the presence of esophageal injury [].\nThe complications resulting from ingestion are mainly related to the duration of impaction. Moreover, the type of ingested foreign body affects the complication rate [, ]. Many studies have displayed findings that support this conclusion. Denney et al. showed that foreign bodies in situ for more than 24 hours were more likely to cause esophageal ulceration (46%) as compared to those in situ for less than 24 hours (23%) []. Similarly Miller et al. concluded that a higher rate of esophageal injury is seen in foreign body ingestion of over one week []. There is a wide range of complications that have been reported in the literature. These include mucosal abrasions and lacerations, perforations with mediastinitis, strictures, pulmonary edema, and esophageal diverticulum [, , –].\nThe child described here ingested a button battery. Previously injury was believed to occur secondary to leakage of alkaline material; however, recent studies proposed that the cause is the passage of a current through the tissue causing hydrolysis of tissue fluids. Moreover, lithium cells have been associated with worse outcomes. This is due to lithium being 3 V cells instead of 1.5 V cells and since they generate more current, more hydroxide is produced and is more rapid than other cells. In addition, studies have shown that the current generates hydroxide at the negative battery pole and as a result the esophageal injury can be predicted by the anatomic location and orientation of the battery [, ].\nThis case highlights the necessity of having high clinical suspicion and intervention early on. Studies have demonstrated that the worst anatomic area of impaction is in the esophagus. Furthermore, there is chance to have injury free removal of an esophageal battery if removed within 2 hours of ingestion []. The child described above would not have developed such serious complications and would not have required major surgery had the foreign body been identified and removed early on. As a result, physicians who are caring for children who present with respiratory or GI complaints should keep a high index of suspicion of foreign body ingestion especially if the child is nonverbal. In addition, new emerging technologies discuss battery coating which if swallowed decreases the external electrolytic currents which cause tissue injury. The authors conducted animal studies and reported significant decrease in tissue injury compared with uncoated control batteries []. More importantly, parents of young children should take extra caution in storing items which could be ingested by children around the house. Small items especially ones that have chemical composition such as batteries should be kept in areas out of reach of children to insure they never have access to them.","{

"A 22-year-old male, driver of the car was involved in a road traffic accident when his car hit against a bridge with his ipsilateral hip and knee in flexion. He presented to the emergency department in 4 h injury time with painful deformities of the right hip and knee, along with Type I open wound right leg with abnormal mobility suggestive of fracture in the ipsilateral leg. On examination, he was drowsy and disoriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale 8/15 and found to be hemodynamically unstable. Physical examination of the extremities revealed a flexed and adducted right hip with the right knee flexed to 30° and with posterior dislocation (). Neurovascular examination revealed common peroneal nerve palsy and absent distal pulses. However, the Doppler showed weak signals over posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery, and the toes were found to be warm with delayed capillary filling. Computed tomography (CT) brain showed acute hemorrhagic contusion. Radiographs showed a posterior dislocation of the right hip and posterior dislocation of right knee with comminuted fracture right distal tibia ().\nThe patient was intubated and hemodynamically stabilized and immediate closed reduction was attempted. The Firstly, an ankle spanning exfix was applied to address the distal tibial fracture, and the knee dislocation was reduced by gentle traction given to the leg. Further traction on the right hip with the hip in 90° flexion with an assistant stabilizing the pelvis reduced the right hip dislocation, which was found to be stable after reduction. Then, ankle spanning external fixator extended to span the knee. Immediately following the procedure, distal pulses were clinically not palpable but relatively good flow was noted in the Doppler both in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery. The foot continued to be warm with good capillary filling of the toes. The patient was on continued ventilator support for 48 h in Intensive Care Unit and serial monitoring of the right lower limb vascularity was done using Doppler. Post reduction CT of the pelvis showed only a minor posterior wall fracture with congruently reduced hip joint () allowing conservative management. Distal pulses were felt clinically from 4th day following which locking compression plate fixation of distal tibia was done. The patient general condition improved and discharged after 3 weeks.\nAt 6 weeks, external fixator was removed and bone grafting was done for the distal tibial fracture and the right knee gently manipulated. The distal tibial fracture healed in 4 months with good recovery of common peroneal nerve. The knee flexion was 0-130° with posterior sagging and multidirectional instability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of right knee showed posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fracture and lateral collateral ligament avulsion fracture (). It was planned arthroscopic evaluation which showed a torn PCL at tibial attachment and torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) at anterolateral bundle but the continuity maintained with posterolateral bundle. Arthroscopic PCL reconstruction using bio screws and open posterolateral corner repair using hamstring graft and endobutton was done. Post-operative rehabilitation included the protocol for multi-ligament instability. At 2 years follow-up, he had full range of movements at the right hip and knee. Radiographs of the pelvis showed a viable femoral head without signs of avascular necrosis. There was complete recovery of the common peroneal nerve (, ). The knee was stable and he returned to his preinjury level of activity.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chest and back pain for 2 weeks'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalHistory': 'Hypertension'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CTA of the aorta', 'Finding': 'Large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down to the level of renal arteries.

"A 5-year-old male child came to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery with a complaint of difficulty in opening the mouth for the past 2 years. The birth history was normal. No other member of the family was similarly affected. His mouth opening was normal until he met with a trauma with wooden thorn on the left cheek region. Thorn was removed by a surgeon immediately, but the patient had progressively reduced mouth opening since then. Computed tomography scan showed a radiodense mass extending in front of the anterior border of the ramus of the mandible, suggestive of ossified masseter muscle []. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed evidence of a large elongated T1–T2 intermediate signal intensity lesion with mild surrounding edema in the substance of left masseter muscle, abutting the ramus of left mandible likely to represent heterotopic bone formation (at the expected location of previous surgery for thorn extraction) []. This finding along with a history of trauma led us to the diagnosis of MOT.\nOn thorough probing into the history, the patient's father said that the patient had a history of pain and swelling in the left thigh region and limited movement of the left leg 3 years back when he was only 2 years old. The patient had consulted an orthopedic surgeon for further management of the same. His front and lateral leg radiograph showed bony growth over femur. Subsequent three X-rays of the leg were taken at an interval of 1 month which showed progressive increase in ossification [Figure -]. However, unfortunately, he was misdiagnosed for any bony growth in his left thigh and advised for surgical removal of the same. He got operated for the left leg in 2016; however, after operation, he had total immobility of the left leg. Postoperative radiograph of the leg showed cord-like ossification of the muscles and soft tissue of the left leg giving pattern of branching tree []. Local examination of the face showed that the mouth opening was reduced to nil []. A full-body examination revealed ossifications and a scar mark of previously operated site in the left leg regions []. In addition, microdactyly of the great toe on both the feet was seen []. Informed written consent was taken from the patient's parent.\nAll these clinical and radiographic features led us to conclude the diagnosis as FOP. The patient's parents were made aware of nature of disease and instructed to take possible precautions. We have kept him under observation because any surgical intervention of ossified muscle might lead to further deterioration of condition as it has been experienced by patient with two previous surgeries.","{

"A 25-year-old male came with complaints of pain in both groins for 1 month. Pain was more in the left groin compared to the right side. He is mason by occupation and his work involves lifting heavy objects such as stones but does not involve walking long distances. The weight of the stone was 10–15 kg and he had to lift the stones at least 3 to 4 hours a day amounting to a total of 100 to 150 stones. The pain was dull aching in nature, continuous, and nonradiating. Pain was aggravated on standing and walking. Patient was able to do all his routine activities but with pain. He was able to squat, sit, and walk. There was no history of any other comorbidities and past history and social history were not significant.\nOn clinical examination patient had an antalgic gait and there was no limb length discrepancy. There was tenderness present over the anterior joint line of both hip joints bilaterally. Extremes of rotation were painful with internal rotation being more severe. Power in both lower limbs was normal and neurovascular examination was normal.\nThe patient was evaluated by X-ray of both hip joints which showed a possible fracture line in the femoral neck on the left and no abnormality on the right (). On further investigation with MRI scan, a complete fracture line in the femur neck on the left side and an incomplete fracture line on the right side were seen (Figures , , and ). Patient was admitted, immobilised, and evaluated for the stress fracture with blood tests and DEXA scan. The tests revealed a normal blood picture and no abnormality was seen on tests done to rule out metabolic disorders. DEXA scan of lumbar spine also showed a normal T score.\nThe patient underwent surgery with internal fixation done using a 3 holed dynamic hip screw bilaterally on two sittings 2 days apart (). Weight bearing was initiated one and half months following the surgery with the aid of a walker. At 6 months and one year postoperatively patient was doing all his activities of daily living.

"A 78-year-old male was admitted with acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, which was treated with venous thrombolysis. Investigation showed critical stenosis of the left ICA and 50%–69% stenosis of the right ICA on Doppler ultrasound (DUS). Angiography showed occlusion of the right ICA with reperfusion on vasa vasorum and 90% stenosis of the left ICA. The patient underwent angioplasty with stent placement in the left ICA 14 days after the episode of acute ischemic stroke []. Both the anesthetic and endovascular procedures were uneventful; the patient progressed without complaints and was discharged 2 days after the intervention. Because the patient was afebrile, and there was no active infectious focus, antibiotic prophylaxis was not given. The patient presented to the emergency department 20 days after treatment with fever. He complained of pain in the left cervical region, and a DUS of the carotid arteries was then performed, which showed only mild intimal hyperplasia within the stent.\nBlood culture showed vancomycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and the association of several septic teeth in the oral cavity, suggestive of Ludwig's angina. Antibiotic therapy was started, but the patient progressed with worsening pain in the left cervical region and formation of a subcutaneous collection with local edema. A second control DUS showed fluid in the muscle planes around the stent graft, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) confirmed the findings of infection at the stent site. A second cerebral angiography showed only minor irregularities at the stent site with mild intimal hyperplasia [].\nThe patient remained hospitalized for 3 weeks on ceftazidime and vancomycin therapy. The clinical course was stable, with a slight improvement of the cervical edema. A second cervical NMR was performed because of an increase in the cervical collection, which showed a giant pseudoaneurysm of the treated artery, a finding confirmed by angiography []. The case was discussed with the vascular surgery team, and because of contralateral ICA occlusion, bypass surgery for stent resection was not considered a good option, and neither was endovascular occlusion of the diseased carotid artery. Therefore, as an alternative, treatment with the placement of the Casper stent (MicroVention, CA) was suggested. This is a dual-layer braided metal stent with micro-mesh that provides greater coverage of the arterial wall. Its use was intended to achieve arterial wall reconstruction by the flow-diverting effect of the device. The course of the procedure was uneventful. Immediate results showed contrast retention within the pseudoaneurysm. Ten days later, a control angiography revealed a reduction in the pseudoaneurysm flow and volume []. However, 1 week later, a worsening of his general condition was observed, with a decreased level of consciousness, arterial hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Septicemia was diagnosed, leading to cardiac arrest and death.","{

"A 62-year-old female presented for evaluation of recurrent left lower extremity swelling. Her medical history was notable for prior deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She denied the active use of HRT and tobacco use during this admission. Venous Doppler ultrasound completed in the emergency room revealed extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending superiorly towards the left common iliac vein. Further imaging with ultrasound revealed compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery as well as a significantly elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein (14.2 seconds) suggestive of MTS. The patient was taken to the operating suite and during the procedure the common iliac vein appeared normal distally, but more proximally the vein was narrowed significantly to a diameter of less than 2 mm. Prior to entering the inferior vena cava, the common iliac vein normalized. Using intravenous ultrasound, measurements were taken and a 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent was deployed at the area of stenosis. The stent was noted to have migrated upward into the inferior vena cava and a buttressing of this stent with a 16 x 40 mm Wallstent was placed to ensure adequate apposition. Unfortunately, this caused further migration upward into the IVC and a 14 mm Atlas balloon was used to help secure the migrated IVC stent. The area of stenosis was no longer stented given this migration. Therefore, stenting of the left common iliac vein stenosis was ultimately achieved with a 14 x 80 mm Luminexx stent (). The patient was started on warfarin with heparin bridging postoperatively. Early ambulation and the routine use of elastic stockings were encouraged following the procedure. The following day the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and an abdominal x-ray revealed only two stents located in the abdomen (). A chest x-ray was obtained and revealed the initial 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent projecting over the right atrium (). She underwent open-heart surgery for stent retrieval and had a postoperative course complicated by atrial fibrillation and recurrent left sided lower extremity DVT managed with catheter directed thrombolysis. Hypercoagulable work-up revealed homozygosity of the Factor V Leiden gene mutation. One week after discharge, she developed hypotension and lightheadedness. She presented to the emergency department and was found to have pericardial tamponade requiring blood transfusion, pericardiocentesis, and pericardial window. Anticoagulation treatment was stopped during hospital stay and not resumed upon discharge.\nThree weeks later, she had a syncopal episode secondary to a massive pulmonary embolus (PE). Imaging also revealed residual DVT in bilateral lower extremities. She underwent thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator and subsequently developed a thoracic hematoma. Given the residual clot burden in the bilateral lower extremity, she underwent IVC filter placement and mechanical thrombectomy. No additional stents were placed. Throughout the hospitalization the patient required multiple blood products after developing a hematoma related to recent thoracic surgery. The patient was eventually stabilized and given the Factor V Leiden mutation and life-threatening PE, she was started on rivaroxaban indefinitely. Since these events, she has been followed closely as an outpatient with no known hospitalizations related to bleeding or thrombosis. At 5-year follow-up, the patient reports that she is doing well. She is not experiencing any complications related to rivaroxaban. She does have residual postthrombotic syndrome (CEAP class 3, Villalta Score 8) well managed with daily compression stockings.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaining of chest and back pain for two weeks', 'Nonresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalCondition': 'Hypertension'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CTA of the aorta', 'Finding': 'Large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery down to the level of renal arteries with aneurysmal dilatation and compression of the true lumen, large entry point seen distal to the right subclavian artery'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Aortic dissection', 'Type': 'Type A dissection with aneurysmal dilatation', 'Location': 'Descending thoracic aorta'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR)', 'Details': 'Stent graft with a size of 34 mm × 15 cm deployed into the descending thoracic aorta covering the intimal tear and obliterating the false lumen'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient discharged in good condition one day after surgery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3-6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No evidence of morbidity, intact blood supply to upper arms and radial arteries'}}}"
"A 41-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with four hours of severe sudden-onset left-sided retro-orbital headache. It was associated with blurry vision in her left eye and did not change in intensity. She initially delayed seeking medical evaluation but came to the ED when her symptoms persisted. After the headache had been present for two hours, she noted some altered sensation throughout her right lower extremity but had no complaints of focal weakness. Her medical history was only significant for depression and daily tobacco use. She did not have a history of headaches and there was no trauma.\nThe patient was evaluated by a physician at triage upon initial arrival in the department and was not noted to have any focal deficits. Her initial vital signs were only notable for a blood pressure of 125/95mmHg. She was evaluated by the treating physicians approximately 20 minutes after arrival and noted to have an NIH stroke scale score of three for slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, drift in the right leg, and altered sensation in the right leg. Sensation was tested by comparing the perception of sharp stimuli between each lower extremity, which was reported to be more dull throughout the right lower extremity compared to the left in a non-dermatomal pattern. The patient underwent an emergent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head followed by CT angiograms of the neck and brain. The on-call neurologist was consulted and noted no focal deficits on exam with an NIH stroke scale of zero approximately 40 minutes after the exam by the emergency physician. Her imaging studies were reviewed and she was found to have bilateral internal carotid artery dissections with pseudoaneurysm formation on the left creating a relative stenosis ().\nAfter discussion with the neurosurgical service, she was started on a heparin drip and admitted to the ICU for monitoring. She underwent cerebral angiography but did not require any intervention at the time, as good flow was seen distal to the dissections and pseudoaneurysm. She was discharged home three days later on an enoxaparin bridge to warfarin.\nShe re-presented to the ED 10 days later with right-sided numbness that developed into aphasia and right-sided weakness. Her initial complaint was tingling on the right side of her face and along the right arm but this progressed into severe aphasia, dysarthria, diminished strength throughout the right upper and lower extremities, and decreased response to painful stimuli on the right side while she was in the ED. She was taken back to the angiography suite and a stent was placed in the left internal carotid artery. She was discharged three days later on aspirin and clopidogrel.

"A 46- year old Sudanese male has few months’ history of gastric symptoms. He was planned for upper GIT endoscopy. There was no significant past medical history and he is not on immunosuppressive therapy. One day before endoscopy, he started to feel right lower costal pain which worsened next morning. His symptoms were initially explained by anxiety from the planned procedure. In few days time, he developed severe localized pain on the right lower costal area that radiates from the spine forward to the mid abdomen. He noticed mild change in the color of the skin in this area with redness, small vesicular rash, and soreness. These gradually improved with symptomatic treatment for herpes zoster. By the end of the second week, he started to feel heaviness of the right leg and numbness on the left. There were no urinary symptoms or fever. The clinical examination 3 weeks from the onset of neurological symptoms showed an average weight and height patient with abnormal gait. The abnormalities were confined to the central nervous system in the form of flaccid right lower limb weakness (Grade III + MRC), brisk knee and ankle jerks on the right. The right planter reflex was unobtainable. The examination of the sensory part showed normal pin prick vibration, position, and temperature sensations on the right lower limb but pain and temperature were impaired on the left lower limb which had normal power. A diagnosis of herpes zoster induced autoimmune myelitis was made and a dorsal MRI was requested. The clinical features of myelitis were in the form of Brown Sequard Syndrome. Mean while the patient was started on IV methyl prednisolone injections 1 g daily for 3 days followed by a 4 week's course of oral steroids starting with 45 mg/d. The non contrast dorsal MRI was normal and LP procedure was declined by the patient. Fortunately, the motor weakness improved and at 3 months assessment, there were minimum remaining sensory abnormalities on the left lower limb with no motor weakness on the right lower limb. The final clinical diagnosis was possible D 6 herpes zoster induced myelitis presenting clinically as Brown Sequard Syndrome. The patient was reassured and discharged from the clinic without further neurological complains for 2 years now.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe right thigh pain after falling off a motorcycle'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Closed right femur fracture two years ago, treated with intramedullary nailing'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': '30° varus angulation of the femoral nail in the AP view, 30° anterior angulation in the lateral view, non-union of the fracture site with minimal callus formation'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Non-union of right femur fracture', 'Type': 'Orthopedic', 'Location': 'Right thigh'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical removal of bent femoral nail, bone graft, and insertion of locking compression plate', 'Details': 'Two-part extraction of the bent nail, manual traction for visualization, proximal and distal screw removal, bone grafting, insertion of locking compression plate'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Upon discharge', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient was discharged without complications'}}}"
"A 58-year old male presented to the emergency department complaining for pain at the left side of the base of his penis 4 h after excessive forceful masturbation. His medical and surgical history was unremarkable and he was under no medications whatsoever. At physical examination there were no signs of penile deformation, or expanding hematoma although the formation of a small hematoma was noticed at the base of the penis (). Abdominal examination was unremarkable, although the bladder was distended and palpable. The scrotum was painful at palpation, but the testicles were normal. The patient was able to void without hematuria and there were no evidence of urethral injury on retrograde urethrogram. The patient was consulted that this was a case of trauma causing rupture of the cavernous body that should be best managed surgically. However he did not consent for surgical exploration of the trauma and for this reason conservative management with broad spectrum antibiotics and low molecular weight heparin was administered. As penile ultrasonography was not available for technical reasons, the next day a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the penis was performed in order to further investigate the extent of the traumatic lesion. Axial T1-weighted MRI showed a small tear in the tunica albuginea and hematoma in the left side of the base of the penis. (). After 3 days of conservative treatment the area of hematoma collection became erythematous and painful giving the impression of an abscess formation while the white blood cell count increased from 9000 to 21,000. The following day the abscess drained spontaneously to the skin, the patient was relieved from pain and the blood count returned to normal (). The pus culture from the abscess revealed Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was subjected to drainage and surgical debridement of the abscess.\nThe patient was discharged after 12 days of hospitalization with per oral somministration antibiotics administered for additional 10 days. With regard to his sexual ability, 3 months after the incidence he reported normal erections although he was not willing to complete the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire or undergo a penile Doppler examination. The patient did not report any other mid- or long-term complications.","{

"A 57-year-old woman attended for routine mammography screening. She was recalled because her screening mammograms revealed three separate lesions in her right breast and one in the left. At clinical examination, there were only two vaguely palpable masses in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast and one in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. Overlying skin was normal and no regional lymph nodes were palpable.\nMammography of the left breast revealed a 15-mm lesion in the upper outer quadrant and on core biopsy it was shown to be a grade I invasive ductal carcinoma which was oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive. On the right side, the first mass, an area of about 13-mm of micro calcification, was situated in the upper outer quadrant at the 10'o clock position, and on core biopsy was confirmed as a grade I invasive ductal carcinoma, also both oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive. The second mass was at the 11'o clock position and the third was in the lower inner quadrant and these latter two lesions on core biopsy showed lymphoma-like features but not breast carcinoma. The core biopsies were therefore sent for expert opinion but this supplementary report was also not conclusive. Therefore, diagnostic excision biopsy was recommended. In the meantime, staging computerised tomography of her chest and abdomen was performed and was found to be normal. Treatment options were then openly discussed with the patient and her family and she opted for a right mastectomy and axillary node clearance and wide local excision and axillary node sampling on the left. She felt this would be easier than a combination of therapeutic local excision of the cancers and diagnostic needle localisation of the other masses in the right breast.\nDefinitive histopathology supplemented by immunohistochemistry was compatible with marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of right breast and involving the lymph nodes of both axillae (Figure , ). In addition, it also confirmed in the right breast an 8 mm, grade I invasive ductal carcinoma (Figure ) with intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ and a 12 mm grade I invasive ductal carcinoma on the left side. There was no lymphatic spread of breast cancer into either axilla. Her breast cancers were treated by radiotherapy to her conserved left breast and adjuvant hormonal therapy. The patient was referred by the breast team to the specialist lymphoma team but they did not recommend any further treatment for the Nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma as it was indolent tumour and they deemed it had been adequately treated by the surgery alone. She has follow up in six monthly intervals.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chest injury sustained by metal splinter under moderate velocity'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Thoracic trauma with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Foreign body in the right hemithorax'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Sharp foreign body in the thoracic cavity'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Foreign body in thoracic cavity', 'Type': 'Traumatic injury', 'Location': 'Thoracic cavity'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Thoracoscopic removal of foreign body', 'Details': 'Minimal access surgery with preparations for open thoracotomy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Prompt recovery with well-expanded lung confirmed clinically and with X-ray', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on the second postoperative day'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Regular follow-up', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient is doing well'}}}"
"This is a 63-year-old female who was referred to the radiotherapy clinic at our tertiary hospital in December 2016, for consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy for a resected retrorectal adenocarcinoma with a positive margin.\nThe patient provided a remote history of a congenital cyst that had been surgically removed when she was a newborn. Her past surgical history was also significant for a hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy, which were performed to address a fibroid and benign ovarian cyst more than 17 years prior to this presentation. Her past medical history was significant for diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and acid reflux. Her current presentation was that of a recent, progressive gluteal swelling associated with chronic lower back pain, which has progressed in the few months prior to presentation. Upon presentation, a cystic mass was felt in the gluteal area and needle aspiration was attempted. Over the following couple of weeks, the cystic fluid reaccumulated and she apparently developed multiple abscesses and fistulas.\nThe patient underwent surgical resection of the cystic mass through a posterior approach and recovered well from her surgery. Her back pain had completely resolved. At her first visit to our tertiary center, the only finding in her exam was that of thickening in the gluteal area scar.\nHer initial blood work revealed normal blood counts, and normal liver and renal profiles. CEA and CA 19–9 levels were not obtained at her initial presentation. The initial fluid aspirate was negative for malignancy. The final pathology of the resected mass was positive for mucinous adenocarcinoma arising within a cystic hamartoma. A review of the slides at another private tertiary hospital revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma; primary ovarian or cervical primaries were to be excluded.\nA review of the slides was performed at our hospital. The microscopic description was that of an invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, as evident throughout the provided tissue samples. The mucin had extravasated to the surrounding tissue and elicited a histiocytic reaction (). The tumor was seen at the margin and reached the skin’s surface with ulceration. Features associated with teratoma, epidermoid, duplication, or tailgut cyst were not seen.\nImmunohistochemistry was positive for CK7 (diffuse, strong cytoplasmic), CEA (diffuse, moderately strong, cytoplasmic), and CDX2 (focally strong, nuclear), and negative for 4CK 20, P 16, GCDFP, ER, and p63.\nAt presentation, an MRI scan of the pelvis was obtained and revealed a large, multiloculated cyst in the ischiorectal fossa, with a clear fat plane between the cyst and the rectum. No other abnormality was noted on MRI. The uterus and ovaries could not be visualized on MRI. Unfortunately, we could not retrieve the first MRI image from the other hospital.\nStaging CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as a postoperative MRI of the pelvis, were obtained after referral to our hospital. The CT of the chest was unremarkable for any metastatic disease. The CT of the abdomen revealed an ill-defined, solid mass at the right adnexa measuring 3.2 cm that could represent ovarian metastases or a metastatic lymph node; an inguinal lymph node measuring 1.6 cm was also noted on the left side (). As a result, an ultrasound of the pelvis was obtained and revealed a solid mass arising from the right adnexa, but no further characterization was possible. An MRI scan of the pelvis revealed fluid collection with high signal intensity and no enhancement on postcontrast images at the presacral region, likely representing a hematoma at the surgical area. The surgical bed demonstrated diffuse, soft-tissue edema and muscular edema, primarily involving the gluteus muscle associated with enhancement. There was circumferential wall thickening involving the rectum. The right ovary was well visualized and appeared unremarkable. There was a left inguinal lymph node measuring 1.4 cm, most likely representing a metastatic lymph node.\nSince the question arose of whether a gynecological or gastrointestinal primary mass was present, the patient was referred to a gastroenterologist and a gynecologist. The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which did not reveal any perianal, rectal, or colonic masses. As the MRI did not reveal any abnormality in the ovary and given that the patient was examined by a gynecologist who did not find any abnormalities, a gynecological malignancy had also been ruled out.\nThe patient was discussed at the tumor board. Given the remote history of the cyst and the absence of a clear primary gastrointestinal mass, the potential diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma arising in a recurrent cyst was thought to be likely, with the main differential being an occult adenocarcinoma of the rectum. The decision was made to proceed with chemotherapy. The patient received five cycles of XELOX chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin), starting 6 weeks after her surgery.\nOnce the patient completed her chemotherapy course, a repeat staging work-up was obtained. The CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed heterogeneous soft tissue thickening of the rectum, and clinical examination and proctoscopy/biopsy to exclude recurrent disease in the rectum was recommended. A mild reduction in the size of the metastatic left inguinal lymph node was noted. The chest CT scan did not reveal any mediastinal or pulmonary metastases. The patient was again discussed at the tumor board and the recommendation was to have her assessed by a surgical oncologist, and to repeat the colonoscopy to exclude rectal or colonic disease. The repeat colonoscopy did not reveal any masses, and a few polyps were removed and were benign. The patient was seen by the surgical oncologist and thickening at the sacrum in proximity to the previous resection was again noted, as was the inguinal lymph node. Fine-needle aspiration of the inguinal lymph node was obtained and was positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. A CT-guided biopsy of the thickened sacral area was also obtained and revealed adenocarcinoma ().\nFour months after the completion of chemotherapy, a repeat MRI scan was done. It showed a large, speculated, intense, enhancing, soft-tissue mass at the surgical bed. It measured 9 cm×5.3 cm (). The tumor was inseparable from the coccyx and was associated with multiple enlarged mesorectal lymph nodes measuring up to 5 mm. There was a large, pelvic lymph node on the left-side wall. Multiple foci of cystic components were also identified adjacent to the tumor. The rectum was unremarkable. In conclusion, there was significant Interval progression at the surgical bed of the tumor, in keeping with recurrence. The patient was again discussed at the tumor board, and the surgical oncologist advised that she had unresectable disease. The patient with then referred to the radiation oncology service for palliative radiotherapy, as she started complaining of pain at this time.\nIn October 2017 (10 months after diagnosis), the patient completed a long course of high-dose palliative radiation therapy. She received a dose of 45 Gy in 28 fractions to the entire pelvis and inguinal area, with concomitant 58.8 Gy delivered to the sacral mass and the enlarged inguinal lymph node ().\nIn January 2018, the patient repeated the MRI scan, and no significant interval change was noted. She continued to suffer from moderate to severe pain and was referred to the pain clinic, as her pain was not responding to regular narcotics. A superior hypogastric nerve block was administered to her.\nA repeat MRI in March 2018 revealed stable disease in the pelvis; however, now in the field of view of this MRI scan were new bone lesions at the level of the lumbar spine. In April 2018, a repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, as well as a CT scan of the chest revealed no distant metastatic disease apart from the bone metastasis. At this point, the patient’s clinical presentation included non-healing ulcers in the sacral area with skin nodules. Her CEA measured 21.9 and her carcinoembryonic antigen (CA)19.9 measured 4767. She was re challenged with maintenance capecitabine. reflects the change in her CEA level over the clinical course.\nThe patient was last seen at our hospital in December 2018. At that time, she demonstrated major clinical progression and had a poor performance status. Her chemotherapy was stopped, as she had refused further treatment apart from pain and symptom management.\nThe patient was last seen in our hospital in December 2018. According to her family, she died on March 26, 2019 (28 months after her diagnosis). She had suffered from severe anemia and went into a coma secondary to a major stroke, potentially having suffered from disseminated intravascular coagulation.","{

"A 10-month-old girl born of nonconsanguineous marriage with normal developmental history, with no prior medical problems, was brought to our emergency room with history of fall on the head when the child was trying to walk on her own. She cried for a brief period and there was no loss of consciousness. There was no vomiting or convulsions following the head injury. Next day morning, about 12 hours after the injury, child developed weakness involving right side of the face, right arm, and the right leg. Child was unable to sit or stand. On examination child was conscious and active showing decreased movements in the right half of the body with muscle power 2/5 in both right upper and lower extremity along with right sided UMN type of facial palsy, with a positive Babinski sign on the same side. There were no signs of raised intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation. Other neurological examinations were normal. Child did not have any signs suggestive of nonaccidental injury and did not have any external signs of trauma to the head or elsewhere on the body. Child had no clinical history suggestive of varicella, measles, or ear discharge in the past. There was no history of feeding difficulty which suggests that there was no lower cranial nerve involvement. Perinatal history was uneventful. There were no significant family history suggestive of thromboembolic disorders and no history of recent vaccination. Investigations like routine blood count, peripheral smear, serum electrolytes, bleeding, and coagulation profile were done and found to be within normal limits. MRI brain suggested acute infarct involving the left capsuloganglionic region (Figures and ). Child was managed conservatively with osmotic diuretics to reduce perilesional oedema and also was started on anticoagulant therapy subcutaneously. Low molecular weight heparin was given for a total of 5 days and was stopped without any continuation of oral antiplatelet therapy. Parents could not afford other relevant investigations including MRA, Doppler evaluation of the vessels, lipoprotein A and homocysteine estimation, protein C and S, antithrombin III, and antiphospholipid antibody. The child started moving her right leg with gain in power after 12 hrs of anticoagulant therapy. The facial paralysis and the hemiparesis improved following 5 days of treatment and the child was discharged with advice of physiotherapy. Neurological evaluation on follow-up after 10 days of treatment showed good clinical resolution, with power 5/5 in both right upper and lower limbs with normal reflexes and no residual facial weakness.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain and swelling in the right leg stump with repeated breakdown of the loading area', 'Unable to wear prosthesis and bear weight on the stump'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Mangled leg resulting in below knee amputation with insufficient soft tissue cover and infection'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Soft tissue deficiency in the stump', 'Type': 'Post-amputation complication', 'Location': 'Right leg stump'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Reconstruction with anterolateral thigh flap', 'Details': 'Excision of scar tissue, harvesting and inset of 14 × 14cms anterolateral thigh flap with vastus lateralis muscle covering the bony stump'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '20 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved pain-free walking distance and standing time, can distinguish hot and cold sensation'}}}"
"A 41-year-old woman with end stage renal disease (ESRD) from ADPKD was referred to our tertiary care center for urgent renal replacement therapy. Considering her actual state, the very long distance from hemodialysis centers and the possible opportunity for a future renal transplantation we concluded to start with peritoneal dialysis. Before starting PD we applied several sessions of hemodialysis using a subclavian temporary cathether. Two weeks after the peritoneal cathether implantation she started peritoneal dialysis. She continued on PD for two years but after a grave episode of peritonitis accompanied with a septic state, dialysis failure, long hospitalization, she was transferred urgently to hemodialysis. Her transplantation plans failed because her mother, the only possible donor died from a heart attack. She was maintained on regular HD, but her dialysis care was complicated by recurrent vascular access thrombosis. The first fistula functioned only 3 months and the second, third and fourth fistula were immature and not functioning. Both grafts didn’t function and were clotted till the first days. During this time the catheters were her vascular access of necessity with all the difficulties and hazardous situations that they bring with them. The third graft that was performed in Turkey, was clotted till the first days then was done the thrombectomy and then clotted again. The salvage procedures failed again. During this time the ongoing of hemodialysis was compromised from the recurrent septic states with seizures and bacteremia especially in the first hour of hemodialysis sessions. We usually used the cathether antibiotic locking in the end of hemodialysis with cephazolin or gentamicin but she gradually went on severe malnutrition due to long term infectious states and inefficient hemodialysis. She was supported with parenteral nutrition, more frequent HD sessions and intravenous antibiotics. This long calvary of suffering continued to the extent that only one access site was available for her routine renal replacement treatment.\nA thorough thrombophilia screen confirmed the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, while antinuclear antibody and anti ds-DNA antibodies were negative. A diagnosis of APAS was made and she was anticoagulated with warfarin. The surgeon created the left femoral graft. It was used only after 4 weeks with extreme precautions. From 1.5 years it is still working and functioning well. Now she has a better quality of life, better hemoglobin levels, URR and she is free of temperature, seizures and rigid catheters that were her nightmare. Now she is not anxious, but for how much time? What if this AVG doesn’ t function any more? What to do with her? A lot of answers?","{

"A 50 year old female patient previously healthy has undergone an abdominal ultrasound demanded by her primary care physician when her routine checkup blood test showed a slightly elevated level of liver enzymes with no other lab abnormalities. This ultrasound showed right adrenal lesion of 9 cm of diameter. An Abdominal MRI was then done and revealed a soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm of right adrenal gland origin. She was completely asymptomatic and the physical exam was strictly normal. Endocrinological evaluation was done with normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hyper secretion of catecholamines. The patient was considered to have a non-secreting right adrenal mass for which an adrenal scan was done and showed a well encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications without local invasion (). The decision of right laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy was taken with the patient. The surgery was done under general anesthesia after central and arterial lines insertion, the patient was on left decubitus position. 5 trocars were inserted as follows: The first 12-mm port was inserted at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle just above the level of the umbilicus to accommodate the camera. Two subcostal 11 mm ports were also placed; one in the midclavicular line and the other in the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. The forth 5-mm subcostal trocar was inserted in the anterior axillary line to retract the liver and the fifth 5 mm one was inserted in the epigastrium and used specially for aspiration and irrigation. After liver retraction, the peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC was incised to expose the IVC just below its intrahepatic course. The duodenum which was diverted by the mass was mobilized. Dissection was next carried inferiorly by incising the peritoneum along the lateral edge of the vena cava to the superior edge of the renal vein. Dissection of the mass was subsequently carried out with special care at the medial aspect where we found that the wall of the IVC and the renal vein were very adherent to the mass which had a lot of small vessels that were oozing during all the time of the surgery (). In addition, the mass was extended posterior to the vena cava and we could not do a medial retraction of the IVC since the tumor was adherent to it. In front of these facts, we decided to convert to open surgery by a sub-costal incision (between two trocars) that allowed us to remove the mass safely (). A drain was put in the retro peritoneum at the end of the surgery, the operative time was 200 min, the blood loss was 850 cc and no transfusion was done. The drain was removed at the second post-operative day and the patient was discharged uneventfully on the sixth day after surgery.\nHistologically, the tumor consisted of spindle cells with alternating areas of compact hypercellularity with irregular streams and without atypia or mitosis (). This tumor was completely compressing and reducing the adrenal gland that was laminated but intact without histological abnormalities (). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated negative CKAE1-AE3, synaptophysine and chromogranine. In contrast to these results, S-100 and CD68 (PGM1) staining were diffusely positive across the tumor (). Thus, the evidences corresponded to a benign schwannoma ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chest and back pain for two weeks', 'Nonresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': 'Present', 'PreviousMedicalInterventions': 'None reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CTA of the aorta', 'Finding': 'Large aortic dissection flap with aneurysmal dilatation and false lumen compression'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Aortic dissection', 'Type': 'Type A', 'Location': 'Descending thoracic aorta'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) with stent graft', 'Details': 'Stent graft deployment into the descending thoracic aorta to cover intimal tear and obliterate false lumen'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Patient discharged in good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3-6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient showed no signs of morbidity or stroke in clinical follow-up'}}}"
"We present a 55-year-old female with ESRD on HD secondary to Diabetic nephropathy who presented initially for creation of a hemodialysis access. She had a thirty pack a year history of tobacco use with current use of tobacco products. She had Charcot's disease of the left lower extremity, amputation below knee of her left lower extremity and required use of wheelchair for ambulation. She underwent creation of left basilic vein to the left brachial artery AVF with a plan to perform a second stage superficialization and transposition 6 weeks later. She denied any complaints in the immediate postoperative period. Physical exam during this visit revealed left arm with good grip strength, radial artery pulse of at least 2, and good thrill in the venous segment of the fistula. She was seen again in the vascular clinic 4 weeks after her surgery with the plan to superficialize her AVF. However, she was now complaining of numbness and mild pain in the left hand which is increased at night. She stated in retrospect that some of these symptoms had started about 4 days after the creation of the fistula. At this point, there was concern for steal syndrome; however, on her exam her hand was pink and warm, and there was still a good radial pulse and a duplex doppler ultrasound revealed good flow in the fistula with no significant reversal of flow and no decreased blood flow in the lower part of the left arm. An electromyogram (EMG) was ordered to evaluate for neurological etiologies to investigate the cause of her left-hand pain. On a subsequent follow-up to the clinic, she was noted to have muscle wasting of the left medial palm and dorsum. Sensation was found to be decreased along the medial aspect of the left arm from the elbow including part of the third, fourth, and fifth digits. Fasciculations were noted in the fingers of the left hand and strength was noted to be reduced. EMG reported a moderate to severe generalized sensorimotor axonal neuropathy in both. A repeat doppler ultrasound of the fistula showed a patent left brachial artery to basilic vein AVF in the left antecubital fossa with partial reversal of flow in the proximal left ulnar artery representing partial steal syndrome. MRI of the left upper extremity showed entrapment of the median nerve (Fig. , ) and cubital tunnel syndrome. A diagnosis of nerve compression syndrome was made and patient was scheduled for surgical exploration. At surgery, she was found to have extensive scarring leading to median nerve compression in the upper arm adjacent to the brachial artery-basilic vein AVF. There was evidence of ulnar neuropathy in the cubital tunnel with hourglass deformation of the ulnar nerve without significant subluxation, and there was also evidence of median neuropathy at the wrist with hourglass deformation of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. She had exploration and neurolysis of median nerve in left upper arm, left cubital tunnel release with anterior subcutaneous transposition, left carpal tunnel, and left ulnar release. The fistula was also superficialized, retunneled, reanastomozed to the above elbow brachial artery. Following this surgery, our patient reported her pain in the left arm had improved but did not resolve completely. Her fasciculations however improved significantly. Hemodialysis was started successfully 8 weeks later utilizing the left brachial artery-basilic vein fistula. In subsequent months after surgery, her pain in the left arm and left arm muscle weakness significantly improved.","{

"An 80-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and a cutaneous lesion with white, purulent discharge that appeared a week ago in the same region. The patient’s medical history was notable for an operation for the removal of a liver abscess of unknown etiology fifteen years ago; otherwise, no other chronic illnesses were present.\nDuring physical examination, the abdominal wall was tender on palpation, and the examination of the lesion in the upper right quadrant revealed a fistula opening with white fluid discharge. The physical examination of other systems was normal. The abdominal ultrasonography performed in the ED showed a cystic mass with a diameter of 6 cm in the seventh and eighth segment: the cyst had a calcified membrane and a comet-tail artifact that indicated the presence of air. The cystic lesion appeared to protrude to the subcapsular area and subcutaneous tissue: these findings were highly suggestive of a fistula. The biochemical values and complete blood counts were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography with intravenous contrast revealed a single, calcified, membranous lesion in segments 8 and 4A with a fistula to the abdominal anterior wall (Fig. ). In addition, the increased subcutaneous density within the cyst was noted. Surgical drainage by subcostal incision under local anesthesia resulted in approximately 100 mL of purulent material. The cyst was not excised due to the advanced age of the patient. Nonetheless, bradycardia and hypoglycemia that developed during the postoperative recovery necessitated the patient to be admitted to the intensive care unit for further treatment. Importantly, the analysis of the purulent material from the cyst failed to confirm an Echinococcus infection; however, Klebsiella pneumonia that was susceptible to most commonly used antibiotics was cultured from the purulent material, upon which a 14-day course of ampicillin-sulbactam was initiated. The patient underwent repeated abdominal ultrasonography, which failed to show a recurrence of similar cystic lesions in the abdomen. The patient was discharged 7 days after hospitalization and was followed at the outpatient clinic. The evaluation of the patient at an outpatient setting by ultrasound imaging 6 months after the procedure did not show a recurrence of the cyst.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Ectopic upper left canine', 'Buccal alveolar expansion from the 22 and 24'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographic Examination', 'Finding': 'Ectopic 23 appearing within the maxillary sinus or surrounded by a large cystic radiolucency, abnormal bony expansion between 22 and 24'}, {'Test': 'Cone Beam CT', 'Finding': 'Expanded bone in the 23 region with intact buccal and palatal cortices, the crown facing buccally with roots projecting into the left maxillary sinus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Intraosseous Hemangioma', 'Type': 'Vascular tumor', 'Location': 'Left zygomatic bone'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Exploration under general anesthesia, bone biopsy, left middle meatal antroscopy', 'Details': 'No visible lesion in left maxillary sinus, vital lamellar bone with minimal resorption, soft tissue component of adipose and fibrous tissue, diagnosis of IH'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No evidence of bony expansion or active hemorrhage, asymptomatic patient', 'DischargeStatus': 'No further intervention required'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6-monthly basis', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Asymptomatic, no clinical changes'}}}"
"A 25-year-old male with a history of intermittent abdominal pain for the last six months was admitted to our emergency department complaining of intractable postprandial abdominal pain, along with bloody vomiting. Having been subject to a preliminary evaluation in our emergency department, the patient was transferred to the gastroenterology clinic for further investigation and treatment, where oral intake was stopped and replaced with parenteral replacement therapy. The patient’s medical background revealed nothing remarkable other than recurrent epigastric pain. He also had a history of receiving proton pump inhibitor drugs on an irregular basis. Upon physical examination, his general clinical status was good, with stable vital parameters. A palpable mass of 5 × 5 cm, along with tenderness in the epigastric region on palpation, was detected during abdominal examination. The laboratory test results, including liver and renal function tests, complete blood count, coagulation profiles and tumor markers were within normal limits. Upper GIS endoscopy revealed a submucosally located mass lesion of dense vascularity at the antrum-corpus junction on the greater gastric curvature. The appearance of the mass evoked the impression of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of mesenchymal origin (). Accordingly, a biopsy was taken from this area. No definite focus of active bleeding was evident. In abdominal computed tomographic evaluation, an isodense and smooth contoured mass lesion of 52 × 25 × 32 mm that contained focal calcifications and was located on the greater gastric curvature in the left upper abdominal quadrant was detected (). Since the biopsy report indicated that the material was insufficient for a definitive diagnosis to be made, a deeper biopsy sampling was recommended. As such, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was performed in an attempt to identify whether or not the mass was malignant. PET showed a smooth contoured mass of 5 × 5 cm, projecting from the gastric corpus into the lumen and containing scattered calcifications, which displayed no evidence of malignant transformation. A 6 × 4 × 5 cm mass was detected at the the greater gastric curvature on the anterior gastric surface during intraoperative exploration. The mass was not invading into adjacent tissues, and contained dense vascular structures (). No pathology associated with other intraabdominal organs was identified. Unluckily, no preoperative histopathological evaluation could be implemented due to the device for frozen sectioning in our hospital being out of order. The lesion appeared macroscopically to be benign. A wedge resection was first undertaken, since the lesion was consistent with a gastric hemangioma. The patient suffered no complications during the post-operative follow-up, and was discharged from the hospital on the seventh postoperative day. The pathology report was consistent with varicous dilatations of the submucosal veins and gastric cavernous hemangioma ().","{

"An 83-year-old female patient presented to outpatient oncology clinic with a large ulcerated nodule located in the left cheek and extending into the left neck region. Five years ago, a previously documented squamous cell skin cancer lesion located in the left mandibular region was excised with clear margins. The lesion recurred 12 months before presentation to the medical oncology clinic; however, due to poor socioeconomic status she was unable to admit to the hospital. Her clinical condition recently deteriorated because the cancerous lesion became too painful and she was not capable of oral food intake any longer. Radiation oncology department decided that it would be difficult for the patient to tolerate radiotherapy because the lesion was deeply ulcerated and it was occupying a large region of the left side of the face. A tissue biopsy was taken to confirm tumor recurrence (). A computer tomography of the head and neck region demonstrated extensive soft tissue invasion of the tumor. She was referred to medical oncology department for chemotherapy. Standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy was not found appropriate because of the patient’s poor clinical status and therefore a decision was made to start her treatment with single agent cetuximab.\nThe patient was treated with cetuximab administered at a dose of 400 mg/m2 every 15 days, from September 29, 2013 to April 10, 2014. After the second cycle of the treatment, performance status improved and regression of the ulcerous lesion was visually observed. While the treatment continued, grade 2 acneiform rash on her face, neck, and mediastinum developed, which was successfully treated with vitamin K1 cream without needing dose reduction. She developed grade 3 anemia at the fifth month of treatment, which was treated with red blood cell transfusions as needed and the treatment was stopped at the end of 6 months because she denied any further therapy. The tumor lesion had completely regressed at the time the treatment was terminated (). At her last follow-up visit, which was 12 months after the end of cetuximab therapy, she was still in complete clinical remission.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Yellowish discoloration of teeth', 'Poor oral hygiene with dental plaque accumulation', 'Mild inflammation of gingival tissues'], 'MedicalHistory': {'FamilyHistory': 'Mother, other son also affected by dental disease', 'PreviousInterventions': 'Esthetic and functional rehabilitation performed on mother and other son'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical Examination', 'Finding': 'Mixed dentition with yellow coloration of teeth, poor oral hygiene, mild inflammation'}, {'Test': 'Panoramic Radiography', 'Finding': 'Thin enamel layer not distinguishable from dentin'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Amelogenesis Imperfecta', 'Type': 'Genetic disorder affecting tooth enamel formation', 'Location': 'Primary and permanent dentition'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Orthodontic treatment, restoration with composite resin, caries-preventive strategies', 'Details': 'Early intervention for maxillary molars, composite resin restoration of central incisors, oral hygiene instruction'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Improved esthetics, elimination of tooth sensitivity, stabilization of periodontal health'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Regular recall visits every three months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved behavior and social conviviality'}}}"
"The patient is a right-handed, 40 year old woman employed as a teacher in primary school. She was referred to our neurological centre for sporadic generalized epileptic seizures and reactive depressive syndrome. Early medical history reported depressive-apathetic episodes during adolescence and early adulthood lasting for some months and treated with benzodiazepines. The first generalized seizure occurred at the age of 26 and was accompanied by attention and memory deficits for one week. Three further generalized seizures occurred in 9 years and interictal EEGs showed widespread slow wave activity. She reported several unsuccessful therapeutic attempts with carbamazepine (1000 mg/day) and fenobarbital (150 mg/day). Personality disorder with several cyclic episodes of depression and maniacal excitation were reported by the patient and in the past ten years she had been treated with paroxetine by outpatient psychiatric services. In the last six years she did not experience further seizures and she spontaneously decided to withdraw carbamazepine. In the last year further episodes of depression and anxiety had recurred, and were accompanied by two suicide attempts by poisoning. After the last suicidal attempt, an EEG was recorded in the intensive care unit and the observation of widespread slow wave activity prompted her referral to our clinic. Her cognitive performances were normal (Mini-Mental State Examination score: 30/30). During psychological assessment, beyond a logorrheic and anxious attitude, a history of peculiar events could be evicted even though the patient manifested initial severe resistance to express the reason of her distress. She reported to experience daily symptoms consisting of seeing the image of her entire body as in a mirror or from an external point of view. She saw herself not from an elevated visuo-spatial perspective, as in out of body experience, but in front of her in normal size and colour without a definable facial expression. The patient could not clearly define her localization in space. She reported unclear changes in the awareness of her body describing herself as projected out of her body with a feeling of dissociation of mind and body for a few seconds. When she saw her double from an external view she maintained sidedness, i.e. right and left sides were represented as in the real body, unlike images reflected by a mirror: if she held an object with the right hand her autoscopic image would hold the same object with the right hand. Her heautoscopic experience lasted for less than one minute. These experiences occurred independently of daily activities, either when she was quiet alone or working. When the double appeared, it kept acting the patient's activities. She explained that the experience to see her double was terrifying and that the attempted suicides were prompted by this distressing experience. She reported to have access to the autoscopic body's thoughts, words and actions and that the experience of bilocation was petrifying and shocking. She explained that these experiences had occurred since her early adolescence, had never subsided and were still present when she was receiving carbamazepine and fenobarbital. These episodes were interpreted as he-autoscopic seizures.\nIn a previous brain MRI performed in another neurological institution, an abnormal signal from the splenium of corpus callosum was suspected. But an MRI-based tractography performed in our institution showed integrity of white matter tracts. MRI scans were performed using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. Diffusion tensor images were acquired in the axial plane with diffusion sensitization gradients applied in six non-collinear directions with b-value of 1000s/mm2. All image volumes were acquired with six optimized directions using six repetitions to increase the number of measures. In addition NMR spectroscopy evidenced no alteration in the right and left temporo-parietal junction (Figure ).\nInterictal brain SPECT with 99mTC-ECD showed cerebral hypometabolism in both right and left parietal and occipital lobes (Figure ).\nA previous interictal EEG showed sporadic posterior bilateral slow wave activity 3-3.5 Hz (Figure ). During her repeated evaluations the patient was instructed to signal verbally or by hand gestures the possible occurrence of her hallucinations. We recorded a video-EEG during one of her autoscopic experiences showing an epileptic activity (Figure ) consisting of a brief (about 1 second) and slow (3.5 Hz) right centro-parietal activity followed by abrupt discharges represented by fast activity of polyspikes and sharp-waves of 100-120 uV amplitude and in reversal phase at the P4 lead. After a few seconds the discharge involved right fronto-temporal channels and then the left parieto-occipital channel. The discharge lasted about 30 seconds. The final critical activity was represented by a 3.5-4 Hz spike and slow wave complexes overlapping to widespread slow activity. No ictal automatisms or motor signs were present.\nDuring the video-EEG recording, before the onset of the seizure, the patient reported an unclear change in the awareness of her body, with feelings of derealisation. Then she signalled by hand gesture the abrupt appearance of her entire body exactly in front of her, in upright position and in the same perspective of her previous experiences. This sensation was coincident with the seizure. During an a posteriori interview she reported the impression of bilocation. In this episode the double was motionless and silent. This view of herself in normal size, with the same clothing and facial expression was concomitant to the right centro-parietal discharge characterized by fast activity of polispikes and sharp-waves in reversal phase at the P4 lead. When the discharges involved right fronto-temporal channels we noted an impairment of consciousness: the patient, with fixed eyes, stopped answering our questions, even though she did not report clouding of consciousness in the a posteriori interview. No ictal automatisms or motor signs were observed. During the widespread slow EEG activity the patient reported again an unclear perception of her body, but she signalled that the autoscopic image had disappeared.\nWe aimed to study functional connectivity by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [], but the patient expressed her unavailability to further examinations.\nWe prescribed Levetiracetam (3000 mg/day) which resolved her he-autoscopic seizures. Levetiracetam was administered following the evidence of the seizures.\nIn the following two months the reported that the seizures did not recur, but depression was evidenced in repeated evaluations, with apathy, anaedonia and anxious agitation. We decided to address the patient to psychiatric care due to severe depressive symptoms and to the high risk of further suicidal attempts.","{

"A 66 year-old male patient had been followed for nearly two years with a mediastinal mass. Two years ago a mass was observed near the left cardiac margin measuring 6.5 × 5.7 cm in a modified left parasternal view of the transthoracic using echocardiography (). Further radiological evaluation had been offered but the patient had refused any further evaluation or surgical intervention. Nearly two years after the initial diagnosis, the patient was readmitted to thoracic surgery department for further evaluation. On chest roentgenogram, a well-circumscribed mass in the middle zone of the left lung field was observed (). Chest tomography showed a well-circumscribed huge cystic mass measuring nearly 11 × 8 cm neighboring the aortic arch and left pulmonary artery, and a small cystic mass approximately measuring 5.0 cm on the sixth costosternal junction. A small nodular solid area was observed at the inferior margin of the huge cystic mass. These two masses were both well defined and homogeneous (Figures and ). During preparation for surgery, angina pectoris developed, and a cardiologic evaluation was performed. The patient underwent coronary angiography, and an atherosclerotic lesion causing significant stenosis was found in proximal and mid portions of left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery. After the coronary angiography, a decision was made to undertake surgery in order to remove the tumors and to perform coronary artery bypass grafting.\nIn preoperative evaluation, we considered it possible that the mass dwelling on the aortic arch may make it impossible for proximal anastomoses of coronary bypass. In order to avoid this complication, we decided to first remove the mass, then perform coronary artery bypass grafting using sternotomy, in a one-stage combined operation. The chest was opened by sternotomy, and a huge encapsulated mass was observed dwelling the aortic arch and the left pulmonary artery with a proximal extension to the ascending aorta (). After preserving the nervus vagus, the huge mass was removed by blunt and sharp dissection. The smaller tumor that originated from the intercostal nerve was also removed from the sixth costosternal junction. Following this phase, the ascending aorta became available for the proximal anastomoses of the saphenous vein grafts. Thereafter coronary artery bypass grafting was performed (sequential left internal thoracic artery proximal and mid left anterior descending artery, aorta saphenous circumflex.) Perioperative findings confirmed our preoperative suspicions.\nThe gross appearances of these two masses were alike. They were reddish, bright, encapsulated masses measuring 13 cm and 5 cm in diameter, respectively. The cut surfaces had a bright, tan/yellow, gelatinous appearance, and a small solid area was observed in the larger one (Figures and ).\nOn histological examination degenerative changes and atypical nuclear features were noted, but a mitotic figure was lacking. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for S-100 protein (Figures and ).\nThe patient was discharged on the sixth day after the operation with a slightly elevated left diaphragm. Voice hoarseness was observed on control examination. On further control examinations, the elevation of the diaphragm had gone back to normal and the voice had improved. Whole body examination to exclude the possibility of Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis revealed no additional tumors. The patient recovered fully one year after the operation; recurrence and metastasis were not observed.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Right thigh deformed and painful after road traffic accident', 'Abnormal mobility around thigh', 'Shortened right lower limb compared to left lower limb', 'Contusion over right gluteal region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Nil'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographs', 'Finding': 'Posterior dislocation of right hip, posterior acetabular wall fracture, ipsilateral femoral shaft fracture, reverse oblique trochanteric fracture on left side, both bones fracture of right forearm'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan with 3D reconstruction', 'Finding': 'Acetabular fracture geometry, minimally displaced femoral neck fracture on left side'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Traumatic injuries', 'Type': 'Fractures (posterior acetabular wall, femoral shaft, femoral neck, trochanteric, both bones forearm)', 'Location': 'Right hip, left hip, right forearm'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)', 'Details': 'ORIF of femoral shaft fracture, posterior wall acetabular fracture, trochanteric fracture, femoral neck fracture, and both bones forearm fracture'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'In bed mobilization from second postoperative day, weight bearing with crutches at 12 weeks', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '28 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No evidence of avascular necrosis, excellent functional outcome'}}}"
"A 29-year old woman who was in her seventh month of pregnancy presented with chief complaints of sudden onset of pain and watering in her left eye of 4 days duration. Her past history revealed the onset of myopia at the age of 12 years which gradually increased and stabilized by 18 years of age. At the age of 20 years she underwent radial keratotomy in both eyes for myopic correction. She developed secondary angle closure glaucoma in left eye following radial keratotomy (probably there was microperforation at the time of radial keratotomy, leading to shallow anterior chamber with formation of peripheral anterior synechiae leading to raised IOP) for which she underwent glaucoma filtering surgery without Mitomycin C elsewhere 8 months later. Records revealed IOP of less than 21 mmHg till few months postoperatively. A year later, she presented to us with a painful eye which on examination revealed flat anterior chamber in the periphery and very shallow centrally (Fig. ). The intraocular pressure as measured by applanation tonometer was 40 mmHg and her vision was light perception with inaccurate projection of rays. Posterior segment examination revealed glaucomatous optic atrophy in left eye. Cyclocryotherapy was done after which the intraocular pressure came back to normal. She remained asymptomatic for the next few years, during which she conceived. The first and second trimesters were uneventful, but during the seventh month of pregnancy she presented with sudden onset of pain, redness and watering but no discharge in the left eye. Examination revealed central corneal melting measuring 6 × 6 mm and an area of corneal perforation inferiorly of approximately 2 × 3 mm. There was mild corneal edema without any evidence of active infiltration and rest of the cornea was clear. Corneal sensations were normal and equally brisk in both eyes. On slit lamp examination, a very thin layer of posterior corneal stroma could be seen in the area of melting. The anterior chamber was flat (Fig. ). Intraocular pressure was low digitally. Gram and KOH stain and culture on Blood and Sabouraud's dextrose agar were negative. There was no history of trauma or any other systemic illness and the patient did not exhibit any clinical features of systemic vasculitis or autoimmune condition. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-cytoplasmic and anti-DNA antibodies were negative. Patient had not used any topical drops during the intervening period. The vision in her right eye was 6/6 with -1.50 Diopters and the examination was essentially unremarkable. The patient being in the late stage of pregnancy and having a poor visual prognosis, conservative management was planned. Cyanoacrylate glue and bandage contact lens were applied and topical antibiotics, cycloplegics and lubricating drops were prescribed (Fig. ). After 3 weeks of conservative treatment, corneal edema decreased and corneal perforation gradually healed. Anterior chamber remained flat, although the intraocular pressure was normal digitally. She was kept on regular follow up and on her last visit; leucomatous corneal opacity was seen at the involved site (Fig. ).","{

"A 50 year old female patient previously healthy has undergone an abdominal ultrasound demanded by her primary care physician when her routine checkup blood test showed a slightly elevated level of liver enzymes with no other lab abnormalities. This ultrasound showed right adrenal lesion of 9 cm of diameter. An Abdominal MRI was then done and revealed a soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm of right adrenal gland origin. She was completely asymptomatic and the physical exam was strictly normal. Endocrinological evaluation was done with normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hyper secretion of catecholamines. The patient was considered to have a non-secreting right adrenal mass for which an adrenal scan was done and showed a well encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications without local invasion ().

"A 77-year-old Japanese man consulted our hospital with a 1-month history of right alar swelling with hard pain as his chief complaint. A physical examination revealed a submucosal tumor with an intact and smooth surface in the right nasal vestibule. The result of biopsy was suspected malignancy. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a round lesion 1 cm in length in the right nasal vestibule close to the pyriform fossa edge of the right maxillary bone (). He had severe pulmonary dysfunction due to recurrent end stage lung cancer and diabetes. The expected remainder of his life would be half a year. Therefore, his very poor condition precluded general anesthesia. To relieve the nasal pain, shorten the stay in the hospital and improve the quality of life (QOL), we performed minimally invasive surgery under local anesthesia. In the operation, nasal vestibular tumors arising from the bone surface of the pyriform fossa could be resected using a right alar incision approach combined with a right gingival incision approach. After removing the tumors, a right alar flap was used to cover wounds with exposed bone (). Histopathology of the specimen indicated poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (). These cancer cells could be found in the submucosal areas in the nasal vestibule, but not on the surface or in the epithelial layers. The edges of the resected tumor did not show cancer cells. Postoperatively, the right nasal pain soon disappeared. The patient was discharge from our hospital 4 days after the operation. Two months later, findings in CT scan revealed widespread destruction of the maxillary bones. We consulted pathologists and radiologists. As a result, it was thought that maxillary bone metastasis from lung carcinoma had caused submucosal swelling of the nasal vestibule. The evidence was as follows. In the histopathological examination, cancerous areas were located in the submucosa but not in the upper layer, and the operative findings confirmed that cancer tissues had generated from the surface of maxillary bone. Moreover, the patient had undergone lung cancer surgery four years before. The histopathological characteristics of the lung cancer were similar to those in the present case. The patient desired palliative care rather than active therapy and died at home 6 months after the operation.\nIn 2008, Sakai reported that paranasal sinus metastasis from lung cancer was exceedingly rare, with only 4 cases in Japan, and tended to occur in males. A final diagnosis requires histopathological examination. Many histopathology results showed adenocarcinoma. Bernstein described that the chief complaints of paranasal sinus metastasis from lung cancer were nasal swelling and mass, as our case. When paranasal sinus metastasis from lung cancer is diagnosed, in most cases the patient is already advanced or end stage lung cancer. Therefore, hospitals it is difficult to radically and aggressively treat the metastatic focus, resulting in a poor prognosis. In most patients, the survival p after the diagnosis would be less than 3 months. However, Miyahara described that surgical resection for metastatic tumors in the paranasal sinus was important for alleviating the symptoms. Our minimally invasive surgery could improve the QOL by relieving the nasal pain until the cancer recurred.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of left-sided facial pain for 3 months', 'Pain worsens during chewing, resulting in weight loss'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalHistory': 'Stage IV metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Brain MRI and maxillofacial CT', 'Finding': 'No neural element involvement, metastases or bony lesions in the trigeminal nerve distribution'}, {'Test': 'PET scan', 'Finding': 'Hypermetabolic mass in the distal esophagus consistent with known adenocarcinoma'}, {'Test': 'Localized mandibular CT scan', 'Finding': 'Metastatic lesion in the mandibular bone with involvement of the inferior alveolar nerve'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Metastatic lesion in the mandibular bone', 'Type': 'Metastatic cancer', 'Location': 'Mandibular bone with involvement of the inferior alveolar nerve'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Localized radiation therapy, sphenopalatine ganglion block, radiofrequency ablation', 'Details': 'Significant pain relief achieved'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Pain reduction to 80%', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Able to tolerate eating semi-solid foods without pain'}}}"
"A 66-year-old male patient with history of previous papillary urothelial carcinoma of bladder was referred to our vascular surgery clinic. The patient had undergone radical cystectomy and ureterostomy seven years ago. Recurrence of malignancy had occurred five years after the operation. The patient had a mass at right side of pelvis compressing the right external iliac vein on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient had also bilateral diffuse lung metastasis on lung computed tomography. The patient had received 12 courses of chemotherapy. Resection of pelvic mass was not indicated because of diffuse lung metastasis. Right lower extremity had severe swelling. Above knee and thigh of the affected limb had larger diameter of 6.5 and 9.5 cm than the contralateral limb respectively. The patient suffered from right lower extremity pain and had a venous ulcer at right medial malleolus.\nWe did venography to reveal the underlying cause of venous stasis in right lower extremity. We did the imaging on prone position. A 5F sheath was introduced through the right popliteal vein. The external iliac vein had severe stenosis and invasion of pelvic mass into the vein was evident. This procedure was done under close monitoring of vital signs and local anesthesia. We transformed the patient to supine position to cannulate right superficial femoral vein (SFV). An 8F sheath was introduced into SFV by ultrasound guidance and Seldinger technique 10cm below the inguinal ligament. The reason for changing the position of the patient was that the procedure of stenting is painful. We wanted to do the procedure under deep sedation and it was not possible to do this in prone position because of general condition of the patient. A repeat venogram was obtained at supine position and similar results were found (). Venography was repeated at 45 and 90 degrees of left lateral oblique views and severe stenosis and tumor invasion were confirmed. A 0.035 hydrophilic standard guidewire was introduced through the sheath and the stenosis was crossed. Then a 40 mm length and 10 mm diameter CONQUEST balloon (BARD) was introduced over the guidewire. Venoplasty of external iliac vein was conducted throughout the stenosis and at proximal and distal parts. Then a venous stent of 80 mm length and 12 mm diameter (VENOVO, BARD) was introduced over the guidewire and deployed in the external iliac vein with the stenosis trapped inside the length of the stent. The completion venogram illustrated dilatation of the stenosis and reestablishment of flow of contrast material through the external iliac vein (). Then a 40 mm length and 12 mm diameter CONQUEST balloon (BARD) was introduced over the guidewire. Balloon dilatation was done through the stent and its proximal and distal landing zones. 7500 units of intravenous heparin was administered during the procedure. A loading dose of 300mg Clopidogrel was administered to the patient after the procedure at the recovery theater. The patient was anticoagulated by heparin for 48 hours and Clopidogrel 75mg daily was also administered during that period. Rivaroxaban 10mg per 12 hours and Clopidogrel 75 mg daily was administered on discharge. The patient was on Aspirin 80 mg daily before the procedure and we advised him to continue the same dose.\nDramatic clinical response was evident since postoperative day two. The patient was followed after three and six months. Swelling of right lower extremity was resolved dramatically and the venous ulcer at right medial malleolus was healed. A venous duplex study was done at follow-up visits. Normal venous flow was present.","{

"A 69-year-old female with a history of prothrombin gene mutation was scheduled for living donor kidney transplantation. After developing spontaneous left subclavian and brachial artery thrombosis 17 years ago, patient underwent therapeutic anticoagulation and maintenance on warfarin for 1 year. With therapy, her thrombosis was found to have completely resolved; however, 8 years later following an arthroscopic procedure on her right knee, she developed venous thrombosis of her right lower extremity. She was subsequently found to have a heterozygous form of the prothrombin gene 20210 mutation and hence was maintained on chronic anticoagulation with warfarin. Over the past 2 years, patient developed end-stage renal disease in the setting of diabetes and hypertension.\nAfter careful discussion and institutional approval, patient and her son elected to undergo living donor kidney transplantation. Patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia with smooth intravenous induction. She had a tunneled internal jugular double-lumen central venous catheter placed preoperatively and radial arterial line placed after induction. Access is sometimes difficult in renal transplant recipients and more so in our patient due to history of spontaneous subclavian and brachial artery thrombosis. As a routine practice in our institution, we place tunneled catheters preoperatively with interventional radiology for our scheduled kidney transplant recipients. There was no evidence of clots or thrombi in the internal jugular vein or vessels prior to placement of the line with ultrasound examination. A peripheral intravenous cannula was placed intra-operatively for additional access.\nShe received methylprednisolone and thymoglobulin for immunosuppression. In view of the patient's history of prothrombin gene mutation and history of prior thrombosis, she was maintained on a heparin infusion with a aim of maintaining the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) in the range of 70-75. To achieve this target PTT we gave a 2000 units bolus of heparin followed by an infusion of 1000 units/h. She remained stable throughout, maintaining a mean arterial pressure goal of > 80-85 mmHg after reperfusion. Trachea was extubated in the operating room and she was transported stable to the surgical intensive care unit. She received 2 l of albumin, 4.5 l of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells during the case.\nOn the 3rd day post-operative, due to continued anticoagulation with heparin, patient developed retroperitoneal hematoma requiring re-exploration and washout. However, her allograft demonstrated good function and her creatinine remained stable post-operatively. She was transitioned to warfarin for anticoagulation and discharged home. Her continued immunosuppressive regimens include prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate. Patient subsequently developed ureteral calculus, hydronephrosis and acute renal failure requiring nephrostomy tube placement. She has since had the nephrostomy tube removed and to date, her allograft continues to function well fifteen months later.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Signs of syncope and haemorrhagic shock', 'Massive haemetemesis'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'History of gastric ulcers'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Upper GI endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Irregularly shaped elevated lesion on the gastrojejunostomy line'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'No lymphadenopathy or hepatic metastasis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Gastric mucosa'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Completion gastrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy', 'Details': 'Maintained gastrointestinal tract through Roux-en-Y method'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'No evidence of recurrence 1 year and 6 months post-surgery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Two years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient shows no evidence of recurrence'}}}"
"We present a 46-year-old female patient. The patient was first diagnosed with urethra adenocarcinoma 8 years ago. Total resection of the urinary bladder with lymphatic dissection was performed followed by combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One and a half-year after the first operation the patient was reoperated on for metastasis of the urethral adenocarcinoma and vulvectomy with left inguinal radical lymph node dissection was performed. The pathology report was in compliance with the first report of the urethral adenocarcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient received 54 Gy/30 fraction radiotherapy. At the end of the same year the patient suffered a mass in her right thigh that caused a suspicion of another metastasis. Tru-cut biopsy was performed and pathology specimens revealed malignant mesenchymal tumor. 28 Gy/8 fraction preoperative radiotherapy was applied due to close neighbourhood of the tumor to the femoral artery and the tumor being larger than 5 centimeters in diameter. Following preoperative radiotherapy, wide resection of the tumor was performed. The pathology reports showed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma. The oncology consultation did not recommend postoperative chemotherapy, but 20 Gy/10 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy was applied.\nFor the next three years the patient was regularly followed and no evidence of local or systemic relapse was present. The patient quit the routine control examinations and could not be followed until 4 months ago when MRI evaluation was performed for a mass in her left thigh. A subcutaneous lesion was detected in the left thigh with typical features of a lipoma. In addition, a large mass in the right femur was coincidentally observed with a satellite cutaneous nodule close to the previous incision scar (Figures and ). Tru-cut biopsy and PET scan were performed to grade the new lesion. The tru-cut biopsy has reported a low grade periosteal chondral tumor. An apical lesion of the right lung which was thought to be a metastasis was also present. MRI and CT angiographic evaluation showed the soft tissue component of the tumor enclosing the bone lesion 180 degrees medially and also involving a 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein ().\nThe patient was reoperated on. Wide resection for the metastatic nodule of the skin was performed first and the frozen pathology reported it as a malignant mesenchymal tumor. The tumor of the right femur was also removed with wide resection including the involved 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein in the Hunter canal (). Frozen pathology results reported clean margins and the lesion being possibly periosteal chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The femoral artery and vein were reconstructed using saphenous vein from the left leg. Saphenous vein of the right leg was not used in order not to disturb both venous drainage systems of the same leg and to avoid a possible venous insufficiency postoperatively. The 22 cm long bony defect was reconstructed using a massive allograft of femur and plate-screw fixation of the proximal and distal osteotomy sites was performed following locked intramedullary nailing (). The docking sites were grafted with 10 cc of demineralized bone matrix each. Pathologic evaluation revealed the mass of the right femur to be a juxtacortical chondroblastic osteosarcoma and the soft tissue mass anterior to it to be an indifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the latter being in compliance with a relapse of the pleomorphic mesenchymal tumor that was resected in 2008. Pathologic evaluation of the resected dumbbell-shaped lesion of the left thigh revealed angiolipoma.\nThroughout the routine radiologic evaluations and PET scan before surgery, a lesion in the right lung was also detected and was reported as a metastatic lesion (). Three weeks after the last surgery, thoracoscopy assisted wedge resection of the metastatic lesion was planned. At this time, the frozen biopsy displayed a primary adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung and the patient underwent a lobectomy.","{

"A 58-year-old female was admitted to the emergency unit of our hospital suffering from acute dyspnoea, multiple episodes of vomiting, productive cough, and fever since 3 days. The patient reported a previous medical history of right mastectomy due to breast cancer followed by chemoradiotherapy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis ten months earlier. In the beginning of the operation after injection of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient developed pneumothorax which led to postponing the cholecystectomy. The pneumothorax was treated by inserting a thoracic drainage tube. After removing the thoracic drainage tube, chest X-ray and CT scan of the thorax were performed, but there was no evidence of diaphragm defect or herniation. Α laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed four months later under general anesthesia with no complications. On admission to our department, the patient was febrile, pale, had considerable usage of accessory respiratory muscles, and had abdominal distention. On physical examination, the right lung presented decreased sounds during inspiration, while the abdomen was distended with diminished bowel sounds and peritonism. The blood exams were within normal values, while the arterial blood analysis demonstrated increased lactic acid levels and compromised pO2 values. Chest X-ray revealed that the right lung was totally suppressed by the intestine and suggested that due to intestinal transposition to the thoracic cavity, a functional right pneumonectomy had occurred (). CT scan of the thorax and abdomen detected a right diaphragm defect and herniation of the small intestine, which was also ischaemic due to venous circulation occlusion (). Urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, and it revealed a diaphragm defect of 10 × 2 cm extending from the anterior side of the right diaphragm to the posterolateral side. Almost all the small intestine and part of the transverse colon were extending to the right thoracic cavity through the defect and were ischaemic and immobilized due to venous stasis. The herniated part of the small intestine and transverse colon were separated from the lung and retracted into the abdominal cavity, whereas the diaphragmatic defect was closed by direct suturing with Prolene 2-0 in two layers. Two vacuum drainage systems were placed in the right thoracic cavity and the right subphrenic area, subsequently. The abdominal wall was closed the next day after confirming the small and large intestine viability. The patient was hospitalized in the ICU for 11 days and was discharged from the hospital 20 days after the operation. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by an episode of acute myocardial ischaemia with increased troponin levels and mild ECG ischaemic changes which was treated successfully with beta blockers and dual antiplatelet agents. Mild fever due to retention of bronchial secretions and atelectasis was treated successfully by IV administered antibiotics. The patient was discharged the 20th postoperative day. A year after the operation, the patient remains free of symptoms and the postoperative CT of the thorax remains without findings.","{

"A 28-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology with a chief complaint of a fractured crown in relation to root canal treated maxillary left central incisor. The patient had undergone root canal treatment of the tooth 3 years back and had received fixed bridge prosthesis in relation to the bilateral maxillary central incisor regions. The patient reported that the prosthesis got avulsed and the crown portion of the maxillary left central incisor was fractured following the biting into a hard food substance. The patient also reported the previous dental treatment to be unsatisfactory in terms of the final esthetic and functional outcomes of the prosthesis. Patient expressed preference for a single crown prosthesis and considered his previous bridge prosthesis, a failure in simulating the natural tooth appearance. There were no other relevant dental and medical histories. The patient was a teetotaler and his family history was non-contributory, whereby the confounding environmental and genetic risk factors were deemed absent. Intraoral examination revealed a fractured root canal treated maxillary left central incisor. The right maxillary central incisor had undergone tooth preparation as a part of the previous bridge prosthesis. Oral hygiene maintenance was satisfactory and on examination, the gingival and periodontal status of the patient also appeared to be apparently healthy.\nThe patient was explained in detail about the various treatment modalities available, the advantages and disadvantages of each type of therapy as well as the cost factor related to each therapeutic mode. Taking into consideration the esthetic and functional demands in the anterior esthetic region and the patient's request for an implant-based fixed prosthetic rehabilitation, the final treatment plan was formulated. An atraumatic extraction of the fractured, root canal treated maxillary left central incisor and an immediate implant placement was decided upon as the final treatment plan for the patient. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to commencement of the surgical procedure.\nThe surgical site was anesthetized by local administration of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride (LOX, Neon Laboratories Ltd., Mumbai, India) with 1:200,000 adrenaline. A modified crestal incision was made beyond the palatal surface of the tooth. The conventional mid-crestal incision was placed just apical to the palatal margin of the fractured tooth. This incision was then continued with the oblique releasing incisions placed along the mesial line angles of the maxillary right central and left lateral incisors, extending beyond the mucogingival junction to obtain a tension-free flap with a broad base. This type of envelope flap design with two releasing incisions is called the four corner flap. This mucoperiosteal flap was reflected and the fractured tooth exposed sufficient enough to facilitate atraumatic and careful extraction []. The tooth was extracted by conventional forceps technique and the socket was thoroughly curetted for complete removal of infected granulation tissue, if any. The socket was flushed with sterile isotonic saline solution and osteotomy site preparation was performed for receiving the implant. A self-threaded titanium implant (4.2 mm × 10 mm, Lifecare Devices Pvt. Ltd, Chennai, India) was inserted at the extraction socket and adequate primary stability was accomplished from the residual alveolar bone. However, a small amount of space was present at the palatal and proximal surfaces of the implant in the cervical aspect []. Autogenous bone harvesting was decided upon and the patient was explained in detail regarding the procedure. A second written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to proceeding with the bone harvesting procedure.\nAutogenous block bone graft was harvested according to the “minimum button-hole” technique described by Kumar et al. in 2011.[] A minimal vestibular incision was placed apical to the roots of mandibular left incisors. Soft tissue attachments were carefully relieved using a periosteal elevator until mandibular symphysis bone in the size of a “button-hole” was exposed. An 11 mm diameter cylindrical autogenous block bone was harvested using a round trephine bur []. Next, the block bone graft was crushed into bone chips using a bone rongeur.\nThe bone chips were carefully packed around the palatal and proximal aspects of the implant []. A bio-resorbable collagen membrane (Healiguide, Advanced Biotech Products, Chennai, India) was adapted over the implant site to establish complete coverage and protection of the implant and bone graft material []. The recipient and donor sites were sutured using an absorbable suture material (4-0 Vicryl, Ethicon, Inc., Johnson and Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA).\nA prescription of 8 mg of betamethasone was given jointly with 2 g/day of amoxicillin for 10 days. The patient was advised to rinse with warm salt water rinses for the initial 15 days to promote wound healing. The patient was also instructed in the use of chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% (Peridex, Zila Pharmaceuticals, Phoenix, AZ, USA) as part of home care regime. The patient experienced very minimal post-operative discomfort and no complications were reported.\nIn order to protect the recipient site and eliminate undue stress and forces from acting upon the surgical area, the placement of a temporary prosthesis was avoided with a mutual consent obtained from the patient. This ensured an undisturbed interior milieu facilitating appropriate healing of surgical site. Six months post-operatively, the recipient and donor surgical sites exhibited excellent wound healing with adequate amount of interdental papilla present at the recipient site around the implant fixture []. A second phase surgery was performed to uncover the implant, and the final fixed prosthesis involving two separate crowns were delivered in relation to both the maxillary central incisors []. The separate crown suprastructures were fabricated keeping in mind the patient's request and preferences. The patient was extremely satisfied with the final outcome of the restoration, fulfilling both esthetics and functional needs.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain, swelling, and erythematous changes in the anterolateral aspect of the left leg', 'Limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in the foot due to previous injuries'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Tibial plateau fracture with open reduction and internal fixation, sciatic nerve injury, femur fracture with femoral artery rupture'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray (10 years ago)', 'Finding': 'Large fusiform soft tissue mass with extensive plaque-like and amorphous calcifications between tibia and fibula'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Peripherally distributed calcification in the anterior compartment and deep posterior compartment'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Calcific Myonecrosis', 'Type': 'Benign soft tissue disorder', 'Location': 'Anterior and deep posterior compartments of left leg'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Extensive debridement of anterior and deep posterior compartments', 'Details': 'En-block resection, antibiotic treatment, drain tube insertion'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Delayed wound healing, no recurrence', 'DischargeStatus': 'Satisfied with surgery result'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No recurrence, satisfactory outcome'}}}"
"A 16-year-old boy with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), diagnosed at age 15, and complicated by primary sclerosing cholangitis presented with pleuritic chest pain and low-grade fevers in the setting of an IBD flare with presenting symptoms of six to seven bloody stools per day and abdominal pain with labs significant for a leukocytosis and elevated ESR and CRP. Prior to admission, his symptoms had been well controlled with azathioprine for maintenance therapy. A chest x-ray demonstrated right upper and left lower lobe pulmonary opacities, and a subsequent CT scan revealed multiple pulmonary nodules with associated hilar lymphadenopathy. Due to concern regarding a possible infectious etiology that would preclude administration of additional medical therapy, a thoracoscopic biopsy was performed. There were no perioperative complications. The chest tube, which was placed routinely for the treatment of potential pulmonary air leak, was removed on post-operative day two after no air leak was identified. The pathology demonstrated necrotic neutrophilic nodules without granulomas, which were consistent with pulmonary manifestations of his UC. Operative cultures and additional infectious workup were negative. He was then treated with a three-month course of corticosteroids and started on mesalamine for maintenance therapy with subsequent improvement in his symptoms and a decrease in size of the nodules on CT scan 10 days after initiation of therapy. He presented again two years later with similar symptomatology in the setting of an IBD flare, and the nodules were noted to be larger, but in the same locations. Between these presentations, his UC maintenance therapy was changed to azathioprine. He was again treated with a three-month course of corticosteroids while continuing azathioprine with resolution of his symptoms and a decrease in size of the nodules on CT scan one month later. One year later, he had developed left-sided pleuritic chest pain and worsening of his UC symptoms. The decision was made to initiate infliximab for the management of his UC, and a CT scan was repeated to evaluate the nodules prior to change in therapy. The nodules were noted, again, to be larger, but in the same locations. Another thoracoscopic biopsy was performed to rule out an infectious etiology, which showed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP; formerly called bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia), suppurative pneumonia, and macrophagic pneumonitis, again, favored to represent pulmonary manifestations of IBD (Figure ). This was, again, suggestive of pulmonary manifestations of his UC. Infliximab was initiated, and symptoms dramatically improved, with resolution of nodules noted on CT scan four months later.","{

"A 12-year-old male child presented to our emergency room with an injury to the elbow following a fall on the outstretched hand. He had a diffuse swelling around the elbow, with no external wounds. On examination there was diffuse swelling with a hard bony lump on medial aspect of the elbow. The radial head was not in place clinically. He had weakness of the flexors of the fifth and fourth digits of the hand with a hypoaesthesia in the distribution of the ulnar nerve.\nA radiograph of the elbow showed a fracture of the radial neck with dislocation of the radial head onto the medial side. However radial head was intact [].\nThe patient was taken up for open reduction on an emergency basis. The radial head was palpable in the subcutaneous plane and it was approached through a short curvilinear incision on the medial side centered over the displaced radial head, and the head could be delivered out. A separate lateral Kocher incision was used to approach the proximal radius; the radial head was repositioned anatomically and fixed with a mini fragment T plate, and the annular ligament was repaired. The stability was checked in the elbow. The ulnar nerve was not explored A posterior above elbow slab was used to protect the elbow for 3 weeks followed by active elbow mobilization.\nPostoperatively, an ulnar nerve injury was confirmed on detailed examination once pain had come down and the child was more cooperative. The patient was started on indomethacin 25 mg empirically twice a day for 3 weeks. The patient was lost to followup from this time onward for the next few months. He reported back to the outpatient department at 6 months for review. He had a range of motion at the elbow from 30° to 130° with no supination and good pronation. He was satisfied with function. The ulnar nerve had not recovered [Figures -]. The X-ray taken showed a suspicious developing proximal radioulnar synostosis and union of the fracture site. The implants were removed. He was advised an electromyography and nerve conduction study which he did not get done.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of aimless wandering movements of left hand for 1 month', 'Interference in activities of right hand by left hand'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant past medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI Brain', 'Finding': 'Cortical hyperintensities in bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital cortex, and cingulate gyrus on DWI and FLAIR'}, {'Test': 'EEG', 'Finding': 'Generalized periodic triphasic sharp wave complexes'}, {'Test': 'CSF Analysis', 'Finding': 'Raised Neuron Specific Enolase, lymphocytic pleocytosis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD)', 'Type': 'Prion Disease', 'Location': 'Brain'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Sodium Valproate 500mg twice a day', 'Details': 'For myoclonus'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Not applicable', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Not specified', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Prognosis explained to relatives'}}}"
"A 32-year-old Caucasian woman presented to an outside orthopaedic spine surgeon at 31 weeks of pregnancy because of a right leg pain and difficulty walking. The patient reported that the pain had come on gradually and it had caused her to go from walking independently to requiring the use of a cane and to eventually a walker. The patient underwent an MRI of the lumbar spine 1 month prior to delivery because of concerns that her pain and weakness were radicular in nature. A limited MRI of the lumbar spine, with only sagittal and axial reconstruction and without extension to the pelvis or hips, showed a mild disk bulge at L3-4 and L4-5. She was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak for a herniated disk and right lower extremity radiculopathy.\nThe patient continued to experience pain and difficulty ambulating. She presented to the obstetric service at 38 weeks with elevated blood pressure and headaches, and was admitted to labor and delivery for induction of labor. After 16 hours of labor, the decision was made to perform a cesarean section because of concerns for worsening of the right lower extremity radiculopathy and suspected fetal macrosomia, complicated by intrapartum hemorrhage. After her cesarean and delivery, the patient experienced increased severe pain in her right hip and was unable to ambulate. The obstetrics and gynecology team first consulted the neurology service, and an MRI of the pelvis was recommended to evaluate for possible compressive femoral nerve neuropathy. The neurology team also started her on a low dose of prednisone. On the pelvic MRI, she was found to have a displaced right femoral neck fracture with signs of femoral head bone marrow edema and a focal area of bone edema in the left femoral head with mild flattening of the femoral head (Figure ). The radiologist described the areas of edema in both hips as possible ON. At this point, the orthopaedic service was consulted and a pelvic radiograph was obtained (Figure ).\nThe patient had no known history of trauma or falls during her pregnancy. She further had no known history of rheumatologic disease nor oncologic disease, prolonged steroid use, smoking, or alcohol abuse. The patient did subsequently undergo an oncologic and rheumatologic workup, including antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and protein electrophoresis, all of which were found to be negative. We believe that the patient had an undiagnosed nondisplaced fracture that went on to displace during her cesarean, most likely as a result of previously undiagnosed hip pathology associated with pregnancy. Since the timing of her fracture was unclear and because of the degree of displacement, we discussed with the patient that open reduction and internal fixation had a high risk of failure and decided to proceed with arthroplasty. Five days postpartum, the patient underwent a right total hip arthroplasty (Figure ). The right femoral head and neck were sent for pathology, which reported a “thin trabecular bone structure and recent medullary hemorrhage, consistent with fracture site.” No malignant pathologic process, necrosis, or any other significant pathology was noted. Although the radiologist in his report associated the bony edema in the right hip with ON underlying the femoral neck fracture, the diffuse area of edema seen on the MRI and noted in the pathology report, without mention of bony necrosis, were more consistent with TOH.\nBeginning on postoperative day one, the patient was allowed to weight bear as tolerated and began to work with physical therapy. The patient did not report any pain in the left hip or groin; therefore, despite an MRI showing a small focal area of edema, she was allowed to weight bear bilaterally. She was found to have hypoalbuminemia (albumin level 1.6) attributed to malnutrition, for which she was referred to a nutritionist as an outpatient.\nAt 6 months postpartum, the patient was ambulating with a nonantalgic gait and had full and painless range of motion of bilateral hips. The patient also underwent a repeat MRI of the left hip to monitor the area of edema in the left femoral head (Figure ). This MRI showed near-complete resolution of the previous findings of edema and flattening of the femoral head on the left, again more consistent with a diagnosis of TOH.","{

"A 29-year-old Saudi woman presented to our Emergency Room with a five-day history of epigastric and lower abdominal pain associated with lower abdominal and pelvic fullness that she attributed to fibroids. The pain was intermittent, colicky in nature and associated with nausea and vomiting. She denied any history of fever and there had been no change in her bowel habits or urinary symptoms. For several months she had been followed up regularly at the gynecology clinic due to the lower abdominal heaviness and distension. Her gynecological history revealed a nulliparous woman with no vaginal bleeding. Her medical history was significant for epilepsy since childhood, which was well controlled by medication, and a laparoscopic appendectomy one year ago. On examination, she was alert and conscious. Her vital signs were stable. Her abdomen was distended with a palpable pelvic-abdominal mass that was hard, non-tender and slightly mobile. Her liver and spleen were within the normal range and she had normal bowel sounds. No lymph nodes were enlarged and digital rectal examination revealed no abnormalities.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed a pelvic/abdominal mass adjacent to the distal small bowel loops separate from the uterus and ovaries, heterogeneously enhancing, measuring roughly 65 × 99 mm with multiple areas of necrosis (Figure ). A CT scan of her chest showed indeterminate multiple bilateral subpleural 2 mm to 4 mm lung nodules, too small to biopsy.\nThe case was discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board and the advice was to confirm the diagnosis to eliminate the possibility of an ovarian origin of the tumor because of its very close proximity.\nSurgical exploration was indicated due to the finding of a large mass that was composed of a cystic and also a large solid component that needed to be investigated to eliminate the possibility of lymphoma or tuberculosis, which is quite common in our population. However, there was some radiological confusion about the origin of this mass and to some colleagues it was necessary to confirm it with a histological biopsy. For this reason, our patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, which showed a moderate amount of ascetic fluid with a large mass in the lower abdomen. When a biopsy was attempted, a large vein on the mass ruptured and bleeding made visualization extremely difficult. Therefore, the procedure was converted to an open one through a small lower midline incision. A 10 × 10 cm mass arising from the terminal ileum, occupying the pelvis and reaching to the umbilical area was found.\nThe uterus, ovaries and the urinary bladder were not involved. After a minimal dissection the tumor was excised with 10 cm free margins of small bowel and primary side-to-side anastomosis was performed. Our patient tolerated the procedure very well and her recovery period was unremarkable. She was discharged home on the seventh post-operative day. She was reviewed on an out-patient basis by our colleagues in radio-oncology and due to the radical nature of the surgery she was not offered any adjuvant treatment. She is still being followed up by our surgical oncology team and has shown no evidence of local or distant metastasis based on clinical and CT scan results after 24 months of follow-up.\nGross pathology revealed a segment of small bowel measuring 17 × 2 cm. It was adherent to a portion of ascending colon. An 8 × 7 × 3 cm white solid mass with a homogeneous cut surface was bulging from the serosal side of the small bowel; it was 4 cm away from the proximal resection margin. The tumor was adherent to the large bowel but not infiltrating it grossly. Few lymph nodes were identified within the mesenteric fat. Microscopy showed that the tumor was composed of cellular spindle cells with a mild to moderate degree of pleomorphism arising from the small bowel wall and mainly involving the submucosa, muscularis propria and serosa. Focal mucosal erosion was identified. The tumor cells showed a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, evenly distributed nuclear chromatin and a few conspicuous nuclei (Figure ). The mitotic count was one to two per 10 high-power fields. A metastatic focus was identified within a single mesenteric lymph node (Figure ).\nImmunohistochemical testing results showed that the tumor was positive for S100, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl 2), and vimentin (Figure ). CD99 tests were negative (Figure ) and CDl17 tests were positive (Figure ), in addition to calretinin (focal) and synaptophysin (focal), and CD56 (few cells). The specimen tested negative for CD34, CAM5.2, cytokeratin 7, 20, and 5/6 (Figure ), cytokeratin AE1/AE3, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), CD31, desmin (Figure ), chromogranin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), HMB45, factor 8, Ber/EB4, and melan-A.\nA cytogenetic study of the specimen was conducted on a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor sample. The result of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure for synovial sarcoma-associated fusion transcript (SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2) was negative.\nOur patient was seen periodically in our surgical oncology clinic and she has remained disease free for 24 months with no clinical or radiological evidence of local recurrence.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain over medial aspect of right knee joint', 'Difficulty in climbing stairs'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Patella fracture 4 years back with subsequent implant removal 2 years back'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray of left knee joint', 'Finding': 'Multiple broken circlage wires present around knee joint, one piece migrated posteriorly'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Osteoarthritis of knee joint', 'Type': 'Degenerative condition', 'Location': 'Knee joint'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Total knee replacement', 'Details': 'Including subsequent removal of broken hardware'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient refused surgery', 'DischargeStatus': 'Patient kept on regular follow up'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'To be monitored for any changes in pain or new symptoms'}}}"
"A 33 year old right handed male i.v. drug abuser presents to the emergency department three hours after reportedly self injecting water dissolved crushed zolpidem tablets into the right forearm. His chief complaint was forearm tenderness extending down to the hand. The patient described an immediate onset of pain, which radiated down the arm into the hand. Clinical examination revealed a fresh injection mark at the ulnar side of the distal right forearm without signs of local inflammation. The patient had a neurovascular intact hand with 5/5 motor strength for wrist and finger extension and flexion. Digital two point discrimination, as well as capillary refill of acral digits was found to be within normal limits and a strong radial pulse was palpated, no ulnar pulse was documented. No further apparative diagnostic were performed at initial presentation. The patient was discharged with analgesic medication and told to return if symptoms aggravated. 18 hours after the injection the patient was urgently referred back to the ED by his general practitioner and presented with an ischemic hand. The right hand was found to be cold and held in a flexed position. There was absent ulnar artery pulse and only a faint radial artery pulse palpable, Allen's test was pathological. The hand showed blue discoloration and there was tenderness over the thenar eminence and hypoesthesia over the digits 1 through 5 as evidenced by a two point discrimination of greater than 8 mm (See Fig ). Emergent angiography revealed no flow in the distal ulnar artery and absent deep and superficial palmar arch perfusion (Fig. ). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and urokinase lysis via an indwelling intraarterial catheter was started at 20 hours after injection with 240.000 IU/h over 2 hours followed by half the dose for 2 hours.\nThe patient was closely monitored for possible compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand with potential need for decompressive surgical intervention. Within 3 hours after start of thrombolytic therapy there was a return of normal skin color to the right hand and restoration of a strong Doppler detectable ulnar artery and palmar arch pulse signal. Clinically, the Allen test turned normal. There was no need for compartment decompression and follow-up angiography the next day (Fig. ) demonstrated restoration of ulnar as well as digital artery flow with normal Allen test. Patient was continued on i.v. heparin until discharge at day 6 after trauma. In addition he was placed on 100 mg aspirin/day for 2 weeks. At discharge he had regained full motor strength of finger flexion and extension as well as hand intrinsics with the exception of a 4/5 strength of thumb opposition. A follow-up at 3 months showed bilateral equal skin coloration, no trophic changes to skin and skin appendages of the right hand, normal Allen test and an intact neurovascular exam with 5/5 motor function throughout and intact sensation (Fig ).","{

"A 40 years old female reported to the emergency department of a level II trauma center after an epileptic convulsion with complaints of pain and restriction of movements of both shoulder joints. Physical examination revealed hollowness below the acromion process on either side with flattening of the normal contour of the shoulders with the arm held in external rotation and abduction on the left side and in slight internal rotation on the right side. No peripheral neurological deficit was noted. No specific history of the mode of injury could be elicited as there was no witness of the episode and the patient could not clearly recall the event.\nRadiographs revealed anterior shoulder dislocation with a displaced greater tuberosity fracture on the left side () and posterior dislocation with lesser tuberosity fracture on the right side (). Both the dislocations were promptly reduced by closed manipulation in the emergency department and post-reduction radiographs showed persistent but decreased displacement of both the tuberosities (more on the side with the greater tuberosity fracture) (, ). A CT scan of both shoulder joints was done for better demonstration of the fracture pattern (, ).\nAfter preoperative workup, anesthetic evaluation, physician consultation and informed consent, patient was taken up for surgery. Lesser tuberosity fracture on the right side was fixed using two partially threaded cannulated screws using deltopectoral approach to the shoulder (). The greater tuberosity fracture on the left side was similarly fixed using two partially threaded cannulated screws via direct lateral approach (). Post-operatively both the shoulders were immobilized in a shoulder immobilizer for three weeks. Physical therapy was started as tolerated by the patient at four weeks. She was able to resume her daily activities by two months. At one year follow-up, the patient was free of pain in both shoulder joints and radiographs revealed consolidation at the fracture site with no re-dislocations occurring during the follow up period. After aggressive physiotherapy, the range of motion was near normal on the left side but slight limitation of abduction (range 0-120 degrees) was noted on the right side.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Features of intestinal obstruction', 'Constipation with weight loss over 3 months'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray Abdomen', 'Finding': 'Multiple air fluid levels'}, {'Test': 'CT-Scan Abdomen', 'Finding': 'Circumferential growth involving sigmoid colon with impending perforation, loculated collections extending to bladder and uterus with micro abscesses'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Sigmoid colon, lateral pelvic abdominal wall, lateral wall of uterus'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Exploratory laparotomy and sigmoid colectomy', 'Details': 'Removal of exophytic tumor with small bowel adhesions, tumor perforation repair, and tumor infiltration'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient recovered well with parental nutrition support, ambulatory on 7th postoperative day', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged for follow-up in 2 weeks'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient passed away at home'}}}"
"Patient 2 was a 45-year-old male patient who presented with a T3 N0 M0 recurrent squamous cell carcinoma involving the entire lower lip, chin, neck, cheek and mandible. He had undergone previous resections of his lower lip carcinoma and a left tonsillectomy a year before. He had received postoperative radiation and chemotherapy and presented with a recurrence of his cancer as well as osteoradionecrosis of the mandible requiring composite resection of his tumor and bilateral neck dissection.\nThe patient’s mandibular and intraoral mucosal defect was reconstructed with a free fibula flap from the right leg with a skin paddle measuring 17 × 8 cm along with a 2.4-mm reconstruction plate. A closing wedge osteotomy was performed at the area of the mandibular symphysis on the fibula to allow for the bend of the fibula into the contours of the mandible. An ALT flap from the right leg with a skin paddle measuring 14 × 22 cm was used to reconstruct the external soft tissue. The left lingual artery and the internal jugular vein served as recipient vessels for the free fibula flap. The ALT flap was anastomosed to the ipsilateral facial artery and the internal jugular vein. As in the previous case, a tensor fascia lata sling anchored bilaterally on the anterior aspect of the zygoma was used to suspend the lower lip reconstruction and restore oral competence ().\nOn postoperative day 3 the patient presented with an acute arterial thrombosis of the ALT artery. The arterial anastomosis was revised and the left ascending pharyngeal artery was employed as a recipient vessel for reanastomosis to the ALT artery. Despite revision of the anastomosis, the flap progressed on to total necrosis likely due to the no reflow phenomenon. The patient received a second ALT flap from the left thigh with a 14 × 26 cm skin paddle. An end-to-side anastomosis between the ALT artery and the right common carotid artery was performed. The right internal jugular vein served as recipient vessel for the venous anastomosis. The right neck was chosen since this area was likely less scarred from prior surgery. At the conclusion of the case a strong Doppler signal over both artery and vein was heard and the flap appeared to be well perfused with good capillary refill. The patient's course was further complicated by superficial dehiscence and wound breakdown of the left ALT flap and he was taken to the operating room on postoperative day 14 for neck exploration and closure of the flap dehiscence.\nThe patient’s arterial thrombosis was most likely the result of exuberant atherosclerosis due to a significant history of smoking, substance abuse and radiation. The second ALT flap survived completely and healed uneventfully. On 3-month follow-up the patient’s tissue coverage was stable and he had adequate oral competence allowing him to tolerate an oral diet.","{

"The patient was a 30-year-old woman who was diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease 9 years prior to this encounter. She presented to our clinic with complaints of worsening pain in the lower extremities with activity and sometimes pain at rest. The patient had a medical history of hypertension and admitted to non-compliance with medication. She has been smoking cigarettes for 11 years and usually consumes 1 pack per day. In addition, she reported a strong family history of coronary artery disease. The patient was taken to the office-based lab located within the clinic and was prepared sterilely for a catheter arteriogram.\nCatheter arteriogram results showed significant occlusion of the left iliac artery ( and ), the right iliac artery (), as well as the distal abdominal aorta (). There were numerous collateral vessels noted, indicating the presence of long-standing proximal stenosis (). The decision was made to use angioplasty to help widen the areas of stenosis. An 8 mm × 40 mm Passeo balloon was advanced from the right femoral artery into the left iliac artery () and insufflated to 6 mmHg (). The balloon was allowed to remain expanded for 1 min and then was deflated. Next, the distal aorta was repaired in a similar fashion. The balloon was advanced into the distal aorta from the right femoral access and insufflated to 12 mmHg (). The balloon was allowed to remain expanded for 90 s.\nLastly, the right iliac artery () was treated using the same method (). After completion of the angioplasty procedure, catheter arteriogram was repeated to visualize the effectiveness of the procedure in relieving the extensive stenosis. The imaging revealed almost complete restoration of the diameter of both left and right iliac arteries ( and ). The distal aorta also showed improved diameter after the procedure (). Angiogram of both lower extremities was also performed. The catheter was passed distal to the stenosis that was previously present in the left iliac artery, to help visualize perfusion of its distal branches ( and ). The catheter was removed from the right femoral artery and reinserted in a distal fashion, to help visualize downstream perfusion. The right popliteal artery was well visualized on angiogram (), signifying strong perfusion. The patient was strongly advised to discontinue smoking cigarettes. In addition, the patient was advised to maintain regular physical exercise as tolerated and take baby aspirin daily to prevent thrombotic events.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Persistent back pain located in the thoracolumbar junction affecting activities'], 'MedicalHistory': {'BMI': 37, 'PreviousTreatment': 'Followed but not treated for kyphosis since age 16', 'PreviousSurgery': 'No history of spinal surgeries', 'Co-morbidities': 'No associated medical co-morbidities'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical Examination', 'Finding': 'Sharply angular kyphosis of 105° with apex in thoracolumbar junction; bilateral hamstring tightness'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Bridging osteophytes anteriorly across apex of kyphosis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Severe thoracolumbar kyphosis', 'Type': 'Spinal deformity', 'Location': 'Thoracolumbar junction'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Kyphosis correction surgery', 'Details': 'Combined single-stage anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis from T4 to L3 with instrumentation and rib bone graft'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uncomplicated postoperative course', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged 18 days after surgery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2.6 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No complaints, normal activities, BMI of 26'}}}"
"A 55-year-old woman visited our clinic in September 2018 with stage IV breast cancer. She was a mother of two sons with a history of contraceptive injection use for 5 years and suffered from type II diabetes for 4 years with routine insulin treatment. She presented with a left breast mass that had appeared several months ago. In the past 3 months, the mass grew quickly and developed a 15 × 15 cm inflammatory wound. A core needle biopsy was performed in the district hospital on June 2018 on this unresectable lesion. Pathology tests revealed ductal invasive breast cancer. An immunohistochemistry test revealed a positive estrogen receptor at 90%, a negative progesterone receptor, a negative Her2 and 75% of KI 67 expression and a poor histology grade. Her referral process to our clinic was slow because of the convoluted administration. During this process, she developed a cough. When presented in our clinic for chemotherapy she had shortness of breath. The clinical and imaging examination revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, a pleural effusion, pneumonic and subpleural type pulmonal metastases (Figure ) and bone metastasis in the form of a wedged fracture in the 12th thoracic vertebra. The pericardial effusion progressed significantly and she very quickly developed a life-threatening cardiac tamponade (Figure ). She was then referred to the cardiology ward. Echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion with flying heart and collapsed right atrium and right ventricle. To release the pericardial fluid, a pericardial window procedure was immediately applied. A chest tube was placed within the pericardial cavity to drain the pericardial fluid from the pericardial space. Further, cytology examination confirmed that both the pericardial effusion and the pleural effusion contained metastatic breast cancer cells. One week after the pericardial window procedure she recovered from the severe dyspnea and all the devices were then removed. A total deep vein thrombosis in her right popliteal vein was also identified and treated with unfractionated heparin followed by 20 mg daily oral rivaroxaban.\nWe then considered a palliative chemotherapy treatment despite her low performance (ECOG 3) because she opted for it. With consent from the patient and her family, we started a weekly intravenous docetaxel infusion with a 30 mg/m2 dose based on previous publication. We planned the weekly regimen for 6 cycles with 2 week rest which would be continued until disease progression. She could tolerate the first cycle of her treatment and went home as part of the ambulatory program. During subsequent treatment cycles she gradually showed an increase in her quality of life and improvement in her whole performance (ECOG 1). A remarkable response to her respiratory symptoms was noticed and after the sixth cycle of chemotherapy her chest rontgenography demonstrated the decrease of pleural and pericardial effusion. Weekly docetaxel was then continued and planned for another three cycles.\nAfter the seventh docetaxel cycle, she sufferred from a cough and headache. Diagnosed as immunocompromised pneumonia she was treated with antibiotic and recovered completely. A head contrast-enhanced computedtomography (CECT) scan was also performed to look for any signs of brain lesions. It revealed a cortical edema without any sign of brain metastasis (Figure ). In the ninth cycle, she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure during the administration of docetaxel without any preceeding symptom. Seizure occurred four times, for about an hour, and she fell asleep afterward. She also had a slight decrease in consciousness after the seizure. She was admitted to the hospital for brain metastasis consideration and treated with a phenitoin infusion and a dexamethason injection to relieve the neurologic symptoms. Her biochemical examination was within normal limits. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse epileptiform waves and a slowing pattern. Furthermore, her chest rontgenography showed the disappearance of the pericardial effusion that was confirmed by echocardiography (Figure ). The echocardiography also demonstrated dilatation of her right atrium and right ventricle with good left ventricle function and an ejection fraction of 78%. Locally, a breast ultrasound showed a decrease in the breast lump and inflammatory lesion, but a new axillary lymphadenopathy was found, confirming the progression of the disease. Doppler ultrasound of the extremities showed the disappearance of the thrombus lesion.\nAfter full recovering from her neurologic symptoms, the patient visited our clinic with ECOG performance 2. We then planned to initiate a second-line chemotherapy and did not give her hormonal treatment due to the consideration of brain metastases although CECT reassessment did not confirm it. Oral combination of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide is among metronomic palliative options as suggested by the guideline. Since oral cyclophosphamide was not available locally, we modified the regimen with four cycles of a 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide infusion on day 1 and a capecitabine 825 mg/m2 bid on day 1 to 14. The combination regimen was given at 3-week interval. This approach was continued with metronomic capecitabine for maintenance till the disease progression. There was no dyspnea episode or signs of a pericardial effusion and seizure observed during this second-line treatment program, and the patient's quality of life was stable. On June 2019, she started feeling frequent breast pain and had difficulty finding the words she wanted to say. She then experienced a sudden seizure episode at home, with similar characteristics to the prior event. She was readmitted for treatment of her neurology symptoms with dexamethasone and a phenytoin infusion. This time, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed multi-focal brain metastases (Figure ). A breast ultrasound also demonstrated additional lesions in her left breast. She received a palliative 30 Gy of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) fractionated into 10 series in July 2019. In August 2019, she started the third-line palliative chemotherapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 after refusing our option for a weekly navelbine regimen. Some days after receiving chemotherapy she had a sudden shortness of breath and passed away at home. The cause of death remains unclear since she was not admitted to the hospital. We assumed it might be related to the central symptom of her brain lesion.","{

"A 66-year old right hand dominate female, with no significant past medical history, presented to the emergency department at our institution with left shoulder pain after an accidental trip and fall onto an outstretched hand that occurred the same day. She had noticeable deformity of the upper arm and was neurovascularly intact distally. Radiographs were obtained which demonstrated a four-part proximal humerus fracture and dislocation of the left glenohumeral joint (). The patient was admitted, and on hospital day 3, she underwent open reduction internal fixation of her proximal humerus fracture dislocation (). A deltopectoral approach was utilized for this procedure. Venous bleeding was controlled with electrocautery. The cephalic vein was properly identified during the dissection and was not injured. There were no other intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged on postoperative day two on 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily for DVT prophylaxis. On postoperative day five the patient returned to our outpatient clinic complaining of increased swelling and discomfort of the left upper extremity. Physical exam showed increased swelling with pitting edema and an intact neurovascular exam. An upper extremity duplex ultrasound was obtained which demonstrated occlusive thrombosis in the cephalic and deep brachial veins of the left forearm. The patient was referred to our Vascular Medicine service and anticoagulation therapy was initiated with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for two days followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days. Follow-up examination demonstrated improvement in symptoms and reduction in swelling. The patient was then transitioned to long-term prophylaxis using rivaroxaban 20 mg daily for eight weeks. A repeat upper extremity duplex ultrasound was obtained showing resolution of the DVT. She completed the remainder of her therapy with aspirin 81 mg daily for 16 weeks at which time her symptoms had completely resolved. The patient did not experience any recurrent thromboembolic events or any complications from her anticoagulation therapy. Of note, the patient continued her routine postoperative rehabilitation program with early passive range of motion followed by gradual transition to active range of motion and strength training with physical therapy. In addition, postoperative radiographs were obtained throughout her follow up which showed continual consolidation of the fracture site with complete bony union at seven months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['High-speed motor vehicle collision resulting in multiple injuries'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No reported past medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis', 'Finding': 'Dislocated left hip with femoral head displaced into intrapelvic space'}, {'Test': 'Fluoroscopy during closed reduction', 'Finding': 'Successful reduction of left hip dislocation and distal femur fracture'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Polytrauma with left hip dislocation and distal femur fracture', 'Type': 'Traumatic injury', 'Location': 'Lower extremities'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Emergency closed reduction of left hip', 'Details': 'Closed reduction with traction, countertraction, and rotational maneuvers'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient admitted to surgical intensive care unit, weaned off sedating medications, and discharged to rehab facility after 21 days'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '4.5 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient ambulating with a walker and attending outpatient physical therapy'}}}"
"A 50 year old female patient previously healthy has undergone an abdominal ultrasound demanded by her primary care physician when her routine checkup blood test showed a slightly elevated level of liver enzymes with no other lab abnormalities. This ultrasound showed right adrenal lesion of 9 cm of diameter. An Abdominal MRI was then done and revealed a soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm of right adrenal gland origin. She was completely asymptomatic and the physical exam was strictly normal. Endocrinological evaluation was done with normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hyper secretion of catecholamines. The patient was considered to have a non-secreting right adrenal mass for which an adrenal scan was done and showed a well encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications without local invasion (). The decision of right laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy was taken with the patient. The surgery was done under general anesthesia after central and arterial lines insertion, the patient was on left decubitus position. 5 trocars were inserted as follows: The first 12-mm port was inserted at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle just above the level of the umbilicus to accommodate the camera. Two subcostal 11 mm ports were also placed; one in the midclavicular line and the other in the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. The forth 5-mm subcostal trocar was inserted in the anterior axillary line to retract the liver and the fifth 5 mm one was inserted in the epigastrium and used specially for aspiration and irrigation. After liver retraction, the peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC was incised to expose the IVC just below its intrahepatic course. The duodenum which was diverted by the mass was mobilized. Dissection was next carried inferiorly by incising the peritoneum along the lateral edge of the vena cava to the superior edge of the renal vein. Dissection of the mass was subsequently carried out with special care at the medial aspect where we found that the wall of the IVC and the renal vein were very adherent to the mass which had a lot of small vessels that were oozing during all the time of the surgery (). In addition, the mass was extended posterior to the vena cava and we could not do a medial retraction of the IVC since the tumor was adherent to it. In front of these facts, we decided to convert to open surgery by a sub-costal incision (between two trocars) that allowed us to remove the mass safely (). A drain was put in the retro peritoneum at the end of the surgery, the operative time was 200 min, the blood loss was 850 cc and no transfusion was done. The drain was removed at the second post-operative day and the patient was discharged uneventfully on the sixth day after surgery.\nHistologically, the tumor consisted of spindle cells with alternating areas of compact hypercellularity with irregular streams and without atypia or mitosis (). This tumor was completely compressing and reducing the adrenal gland that was laminated but intact without histological abnormalities (). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated negative CKAE1-AE3, synaptophysine and chromogranine. In contrast to these results, S-100 and CD68 (PGM1) staining were diffusely positive across the tumor (). Thus, the evidences corresponded to a benign schwannoma ().","{

"A 62-year-old female presented for evaluation of recurrent left lower extremity swelling. Her medical history was notable for prior deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She denied the active use of HRT and tobacco use during this admission. Venous Doppler ultrasound completed in the emergency room revealed extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending superiorly towards the left common iliac vein. Further imaging with ultrasound revealed compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery as well as a significantly elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein (14.2 seconds) suggestive of MTS. The patient was taken to the operating suite and during the procedure the common iliac vein appeared normal distally, but more proximally the vein was narrowed significantly to a diameter of less than 2 mm. Prior to entering the inferior vena cava, the common iliac vein normalized. Using intravenous ultrasound, measurements were taken and a 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent was deployed at the area of stenosis. The stent was noted to have migrated upward into the inferior vena cava and a buttressing of this stent with a 16 x 40 mm Wallstent was placed to ensure adequate apposition. Unfortunately, this caused further migration upward into the IVC and a 14 mm Atlas balloon was used to help secure the migrated IVC stent. The area of stenosis was no longer stented given this migration. Therefore, stenting of the left common iliac vein stenosis was ultimately achieved with a 14 x 80 mm Luminexx stent (). The patient was started on warfarin with heparin bridging postoperatively. Early ambulation and the routine use of elastic stockings were encouraged following the procedure. The following day the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and an abdominal x-ray revealed only two stents located in the abdomen (). A chest x-ray was obtained and revealed the initial 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent projecting over the right atrium (). She underwent open-heart surgery for stent retrieval and had a postoperative course complicated by atrial fibrillation and recurrent left sided lower extremity DVT managed with catheter directed thrombolysis. Hypercoagulable work-up revealed homozygosity of the Factor V Leiden gene mutation. One week after discharge, she developed hypotension and lightheadedness. She presented to the emergency department and was found to have pericardial tamponade requiring blood transfusion, pericardiocentesis, and pericardial window. Anticoagulation treatment was stopped during hospital stay and not resumed upon discharge.\nThree weeks later, she had a syncopal episode secondary to a massive pulmonary embolus (PE). Imaging also revealed residual DVT in bilateral lower extremities. She underwent thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator and subsequently developed a thoracic hematoma. Given the residual clot burden in the bilateral lower extremity, she underwent IVC filter placement and mechanical thrombectomy. No additional stents were placed. Throughout the hospitalization the patient required multiple blood products after developing a hematoma related to recent thoracic surgery. The patient was eventually stabilized and given the Factor V Leiden mutation and life-threatening PE, she was started on rivaroxaban indefinitely. Since these events, she has been followed closely as an outpatient with no known hospitalizations related to bleeding or thrombosis. At 5-year follow-up, the patient reports that she is doing well. She is not experiencing any complications related to rivaroxaban. She does have residual postthrombotic syndrome (CEAP class 3, Villalta Score 8) well managed with daily compression stockings.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Swelling and pain in the right groin'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No remarkable medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT', 'Finding': 'Prolapse of the small intestine into the right groin suggesting an indirect hernia'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Right indirect inguinal hernia with femoral hernia', 'Type': 'Hernia', 'Location': 'Right groin'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair', 'Details': 'Repair of right indirect inguinal hernia and femoral hernia with Bard 3D Max Light ® mesh'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged 2 days post surgery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No complications or recurrence reported'}}}"

"A 62-year-old female presented for evaluation of recurrent left lower extremity swelling. Her medical history was notable for prior deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She denied the active use of HRT and tobacco use during this admission. Venous Doppler ultrasound completed in the emergency room revealed extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending superiorly towards the left common iliac vein. Further imaging with ultrasound revealed compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery as well as a significantly elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein (14.2 seconds) suggestive of MTS. The patient was taken to the operating suite and during the procedure the common iliac vein appeared normal distally, but more proximally the vein was narrowed significantly to a diameter of less than 2 mm. Prior to entering the inferior vena cava, the common iliac vein normalized. Using intravenous ultrasound, measurements were taken and a 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent was deployed at the area of stenosis. The stent was noted to have migrated upward into the inferior vena cava and a buttressing of this stent with a 16 x 40 mm Wallstent was placed to ensure adequate apposition. Unfortunately, this caused further migration upward into the IVC and a 14 mm Atlas balloon was used to help secure the migrated IVC stent. The area of stenosis was no longer stented given this migration. Therefore, stenting of the left common iliac vein stenosis was ultimately achieved with a 14 x 80 mm Luminexx stent (). The patient was started on warfarin with heparin bridging postoperatively. Early ambulation and the routine use of elastic stockings were encouraged following the procedure. The following day the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and an abdominal x-ray revealed only two stents located in the abdomen (). A chest x-ray was obtained and revealed the initial 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent projecting over the right atrium (). She underwent open-heart surgery for stent retrieval and had a postoperative course complicated by atrial fibrillation and recurrent left sided lower extremity DVT managed with catheter directed thrombolysis. Hypercoagulable work-up revealed homozygosity of the Factor V Leiden gene mutation. One week after discharge, she developed hypotension and lightheadedness. She presented to the emergency department and was found to have pericardial tamponade requiring blood transfusion, pericardiocentesis, and pericardial window. Anticoagulation treatment was stopped during hospital stay and not resumed upon discharge.\nThree weeks later, she had a syncopal episode secondary to a massive pulmonary embolus (PE). Imaging also revealed residual DVT in bilateral lower extremities. She underwent thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator and subsequently developed a thoracic hematoma. Given the residual clot burden in the bilateral lower extremity, she underwent IVC filter placement and mechanical thrombectomy. No additional stents were placed. Throughout the hospitalization the patient required multiple blood products after developing a hematoma related to recent thoracic surgery. The patient was eventually stabilized and given the Factor V Leiden mutation and life-threatening PE, she was started on rivaroxaban indefinitely. Since these events, she has been followed closely as an outpatient with no known hospitalizations related to bleeding or thrombosis. At 5-year follow-up, the patient reports that she is doing well. She is not experiencing any complications related to rivaroxaban. She does have residual postthrombotic syndrome (CEAP class 3, Villalta Score 8) well managed with daily compression stockings.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Shortness of breath', 'Progressive abdominal distension and pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'ObstetricHistory': {'Gravida': 3, 'Para': 2, 'FirstDelivery': 'Uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery at home', 'SecondDelivery': 'Spontaneous vaginal delivery with early neonatal death'}, 'PrenatalCare': {'LimitedPrenatalVisits': True, 'SingleVisitDuringCurrentPregnancy': True}, 'SymptomsDuringPregnancy': ['Progressive abdominal pain']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Singleton live pregnancy with excessive amniotic fluid, placenta attached to serosal surface of fundus, uterine rupture'}, {'Test': 'Hematocrit test', 'Finding': 'Preoperative hematocrit of 34%, post-transfusion hematocrit of 27%'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Abdominal pregnancy', 'Type': 'Obstetric complication', 'Location': 'Abdominal cavity'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Emergency laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy', 'Details': 'Removal of fetus, placenta, and ruptured uterus, hemostasis, blood transfusion'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient and neonate progressed well', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged'}}}"
"A 35-year-old gravida 3, parity 2 woman was admitted to the hospital for vaginal bleeding and severe abdominal pain. Her past medical history was free of any medical problems. On her obstetric history, she had a vaginal delivery following an uneventful pregnancy course 8 years ago. Her second pregnancy was terminated via hysterotomy at 18th weeks due to multiple fetal abnormalities including hydrocephalus. She was diagnosed to have total anterior placenta previa on her third pregnancy. This last pregnancy was otherwise uneventful and the patient gave birth to a term, healthy infant via planned repeat cesarean section in a private hospital. During the operation, partially adherent placenta had been detected and the adherent part of the placenta had been left in situ. Postoperative treatment had not been given. 20 days after the operation, she had been hospitalized due to massive vaginal bleeding and had been transfused four units of packed red blood cells since her blood count revealed severe anemia with a hemoglobin level of 5.6 gr/dL. She had been discharged from hospital three days later. However, one week later, she had presented to another center due to vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. She had been referred to our hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of placental retention because ultrasonography showed soft tissue density with irregular contour in the endometrial cavity (). On her admission, she had findings consistent with acute abdomen and moderate abdominal distention was detected. Her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and heart rate was 110/minute. Hemoglobin was 8.5 gr/dL on complete blood count. Ultrasonography revealed free fluid filling the pelvis and lower abdomen. Her serum human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. After obtaining informed consent including hysterectomy, an emergency laparotomy was performed. Following drainage of approximately 1000 mL of free blood from the abdominal cavity, a full-thickness defect on the anterior wall of the uterus was seen (). The defect involved the hysterotomy incision and both sides of the incision were occupied by irregular placental tissue with no obvious normal myometrium. Blood was oozing from the defect. Posterior bladder wall was also invaded by placenta and mobilization of the bladder off the lower uterine segment could not be achieved. Total abdominal hysterectomy with partial resection of the posterior bladder wall was performed (). The patient was discharged from the hospital on fourth postoperative day with a bladder catheter that was removed one week after the operation. She was asymptomatic on her control visit performed six weeks later.","{

"A 41-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 2-year history of palpable mass in the right lateral aspect of the neck. There was no past history of irradiation or trauma in the head and neck. On physical examination, a firm and non-tender mass was palpable in the right lateral neck measuring 3.0 cm at the level of the cricoid cartilage without associated cervical lymphadenopathy. No abnormal laboratory findings were seen in routine laboratory investigations and euthyroid state in thyroid function test.\nNeck ultrasonography revealed a solitary nodule measuring 0.5 cm in the right thyroid gland, and a 3.0 cm mixed solid and cystic mass in the right lateral aspect of the neck at level III (). Computed tomography also showed mixed solid and cystic lesion associated with punctate calcification ().\nExamination of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNA) on thyroid gland confirmed follicular cell proliferative lesion. But, the right lateral neck mass was suggestive of metastatic papillary carcinoma. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with presumed metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the right lateral neck and occult papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right thyroid gland.\nThe patient underwent right lateral neck dissection followed by total thyroidectomy. It must be emphasized that papillary carcinoma arising in a right lateral BCC was not in the differential diagnoses preoperatively. The intraoperative findings included a 3.0 cm dark brown fluid filled cystic mass lateral to the internal jugular vein without cyst rupture at the time of the operation, and revealed PTC on the frozen section biopsy. Therefore, a total thyroidectomy was followed.\nHistopathologic examination of the 3.0 cm cystic mass was confirmed papillary carcinoma in a BCC (). The cyst was partially lined by squamous epithelium surrounded by fibrous tissues associated with chronic inflammation (). But there was no normal thyroid tissue adjacent to the focus of papillary carcinoma within the cyst wall ().\nHistopathologic examination of the thyroid gland revealed nodular hyperplasia of the right lobe without evidence of malignancy. Repeated serial sectioning of the whole thyroid and even in postoperative positron emission tomography does not reveal any foci of carcinoma. Other harvested right lateral lymph nodes were examined but there were no evidence of any other abnormal findings.\nIt is known that immunohistochemical staining through TG, TTF-1 and p63 could help in the differential diagnosis in thyroglossal duct cyst, BCC, and papillary carcinoma in BCC (). In our case, the squamous epithelium was positive for p63 and negative for TG and TTF-1 (). On the other hand, papillary carcinoma in BCC was positive on TG and TTF-1, but negative on p63. This issue for immunohistochemical staining will be explained later on discussion.\nThe patient has remained disease free having been followed up for 28 months. She is being managed with post-operative levothyroxine replacement without radioactive iodine therapy.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Adverse reaction to clozapine'], 'MedicalHistory': {'CurrentDiagnosis': 'Chronic schizophrenia (ICD10 F20)', 'PreviousDiagnosis': ['Thoracic trauma with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib'], 'FamilyHistory': ['Son and maternal cousin with schizophrenia']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Blood biochemistry', 'Findings': {'CRP': '197 mg/L', 'Lymphocytes': '1.04 (1.3-3.5 x 10^9)', 'Neutrophils': '8.2 (2.0-7.5 x 10^9)', 'Creatinine': '87 μmol/L'}}, {'Test': 'Midstream specimen of urine', 'Findings': {'Pus Cells': 'Scanty', 'Organisms': 'Present', 'RBCs': 'None'}}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Adverse reaction to clozapine', 'Type': 'Adverse drug reaction'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Clozapine trial', 'Details': 'Clozapine started at 12.5 mg at night'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Resolved after discontinuation of clozapine and treatment for suspected infection'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Renal function returned to normal'}}}"
"A 56-year-old man who had a 2-month history of shortness of breath was presented to a local clinic with a sudden onset of chest pain. He was transferred to the local hospital and was tested. Physical examination revealed tachycardia and mild tachypnea. Coronary arteriography showed normal coronary arteries. The next day, a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and heavy burden of pulmonary emboli in bilateral pulmonary arteries and branches were shown (). An abdominal CT revealed a large mass in the right kidney () and a thrombus in the right renal vein extending into an inferior vena cava (IVC) (). Echocardiography showed mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension. Low molecular weight heparin was initiated and the patient was admitted to Samsung Medical Center. Seven days later, the patient underwent a right radical nephrectomy, a resection of the extended tumor in the abdominal IVC and a pulmonary embolectomy in one session. The right radical nephrectomy was performed via laparotomy first. At the same time, the lower abdominal IVC was exposed to insert venous cannula to run the heart-lung machine. In succeeding, through a median sternotomy, ascending aortic arterial cannulation and triple venous cannulation of superior vena cava, thoracic IVC, and infra-renal IVC were made. On beating heart under cardiopulmonary bypass, resection of the extended tumor in the abdominal IVC was performed (). And then, emboli in the left pulmonary artery and its branches were pulled out with forceps via left pulmonary arteriotomy following vent catheter insertion into right ventricle through proximal main pulmonary artery with distal main pulmonary artery snaring (). The emboli on the other side were removed with same manner via right pulmonary arteriotomy (). After primary repair of both pulmonary arteries, cardiopulmonary bypass was weaned off. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 208 minutes. The renal mass was proved to be renal cell carcinoma. Thrombi in abdominal IVC and pulmonary arteries were confirmed as tumor emboli of renal cell carcinoma. Seventeen days after the surgery, the patient was discharged without any complications. In the follow-up chest CT taken one week after operation, most of emboli were removed except tiny remnant in the left lower lobe posterobasal segmental pulmonary artery (). Two months after operation, positron emission tomography-CT () and magnetic resonance imaging () showed single metastatic liver mass, but no pulmonary metastasis. Patient underwent radiofrequency ablation of liver mass. And the mass was completely destroyed. No further treatment was recommended by oncologist other than regular follow-up.","{

"A 70-year-old male patient was referred to the emergency department with a sudden- onset back pain complaint that lasted for approximately 3 days. His medical history included hypertension. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in the arterial phase revealed the aneurysm’s origin, the aortic arch and branches in each of the three planes, and the structure of the aneurysm, its diameter, segment length, and relationship of the aneurysm with the supraaortic structures. CT from another medical center detected an impending aneurysm rupture in the descending aorta with a diameter of 64 mm (). Both carotid arteries originated from a common trunk from the aortic arch, and there was no aneurysmatic dilatation in the aortic arch. Ascending aorta aneurysm, reaching 60 mm in diameter at the largest, was detected. Aortic regurgitation was not detected in transthoracic echocardiography. Aortic arch was not aneurysmatic. The patient was evaluated in cardiovascular surgery and invasive radiology joint council. Due to the character of the back pain, only an emergent surgical intervention to impending aneurysm rupture at descending aorta was decided. Endovascular repair to the descending aortic aneurysm was planned. The occlusion of the left SA orifice was planned after it was considered that there was not enough neck to position the proximal stent graft. The right SA was aberrant, and the orifice of the right aberrant SA was within the aneurysm sac that was going to be occluded. It was decided to bypass both SAs. Since the patient had ascending aortic aneurysm, and this aneurysm had an elective surgery indication, an extra-anatomic bypass was decided instead of median sternotomy. Because of the widespread aneurysm in the patient and the associated risk of atherosclerosis and the condition of the Willis polygon are unknown, it was decided to use ECA for the donor artery if calibration was appropriate to avoid brain ischemia. To avoid arm ischemia, it was decided to perform bypass operations first.\nOne of the operating rooms at the cardiac surgery clinic in our hospital is specifically designed for diagnostic and interventional procedures using radiation. We have a C-armed scopy and carbon surgery table in this room. Hybrid interventions or operations that may require a multidisciplinary hybrid approach are performed in this room. Every day, we have common councils of cardiovascular surgery and interventional radiology departments. Interventional teams are created if necessary. We decided to perform hybrid surgery as an interventional team. The patient underwent emergent surgery by both cardiovascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics simultaneously at the hybrid operating theater. Under general anesthesia, both ECAs were explored and taken under control. Both ECAs were found to have a good calibration. Both SA were explored via infraclavicular approach and taken under control. The right ECA–right SA bypass procedure was performed with a 6-mm-ring PTFE graft (over the clavicle) by tunneling under the skin. The left ECA–left SA bypass procedure was performed with an 8-mm-ring PTFE (over the clavicle) graft by tunneling under the skin. The right common femoral artery was explored and taken under control. A 7F sheath was placed. The TEVAR procedure was performed to the descending aortic aneurysm with a Medtronic Valiant stent graft (46x46x150 mm). The aortic Zone 2 was selected as the proximal landing zone of the stent graft. Due to the position of the aberrant right RA in the descending aortic aneurysm, the right SA was occluded proximally to the anastomosis to avoid a Type 2 endoleak. No intervention was performed to the right vertebral artery. After the procedure, control angiography showed no sign of endoleak, and anastomosis with the PTFE grafts was found to be open ().\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with respiratory support. Postoperative pulses of both the radial and ulnar arteries were palpable. There was no major or minor neurological complication. Routine follow-ups were stable. We decided to perform surgery for the ascending aortic aneurysm in a further session. The patient was discharged without any problems on the postoperative 7th day. CT angiography was performed on the postoperative 30th day. There was not any evidence of endoleak in control CT angiography (, ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Bilateral hip pain, right worse than left', 'Shortening of right leg compared to left'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgery': 'Bilateral THAs using Biomet Bi-Metric stem and Ringloc cup in 1995'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Brooker III/IV heterotopic ossification around both hips'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Periprosthetic infections', 'Type': 'Infection', 'Location': 'Between thigh and hip prosthesis'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Antibiotic suppression therapy (AST)', 'Details': 'Managed without infectious disease consultation'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No signs of infection or loosening after 12 years', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '12 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No hip pain, good range of motion'}}}"
"A 36-year-old man, originally from Latin America, presented at our outpatient department with complaints of abdominal pain that had persisted for 2 months. The patient had first noticed right lateral abdominal pain 2 months prior to the visit, and the pain was gradually worsening. The abdominal pain was localized in an area ranging from the right upper to the right lateral abdomen. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital. He had returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at our clinic. When he went back to Japan, his weight had increased from 130 kg to 145 kg. He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin. Abdominal pain persisted despite treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate, and any cause of abdominal pain was not detected on further evaluations, including hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, or abdominal computed tomography (CT). Finally, he was referred to our hospital for further examination.\nThe results of screening for depression were negative, and the patient did not have symptoms such as loss of interest, depressed feelings, or any specific changes of surrounding conditions, such as family or work environment changes. He had no history of sexually transmitted infection, and his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination result was positive for Carnett’s test, and a prior surgical scar of approximately 18 cm was apparent at the right subcostal region. The patient experienced strong pain surrounding the surgical scar that was exacerbated by tapping. There were no skin rashes localized surrounding the pain. His pain exacerbated to 8 on a pain scale when he moved, such as during standing up or rolling over simultaneously. When he stopped moving, pain was partially relieved within 1 minute (3 on a pain scale). When he moved again, abdominal pain was again exacerbated. Hence, he was awakened by the abdominal pain when rolling over. No inflammation was detected (leukocyte count was 8580/mm3 and C-reactive protein was 0.10 mg/dl), and other laboratory findings were nonspecific, including liver/kidney function, blood glucose, and electrolytes. Urinary analysis indicated red blood cell count < 1/high-power field, white blood cell count 1–4/high-power field. Additionally, no abnormality was detected for Chlamydia trachomatis IgG/IgA, and no abnormality was apparent on the electrocardiogram. Enhanced CT revealed bilateral renal stones and fatty liver.\nWe first considered abdominal wall pain due to nerve entrapment because the Carnett’s test result was positive; therefore, we scheduled a trigger point injection at the site of tenderness. About 2 weeks later, the patient visited the emergency department of our hospital, reporting that his prior abdominal pain had decreased but that he was experiencing right inguinal pain. Loxoprofen administration had no effect on the pain. Costovertebral angle pain was apparent on tapping, the result of urine analysis was positive for occult blood, and abdominal CT revealed a urinary stone at the right urinary duct to the bladder. After pentazocine hydrochloride was administered for pain relief, the urinary stone was passed the following day. However, the patient’s right lateral abdominal pain was not relieved.\nHe felt that lying in the lateral position mostly relieved his pain. He had occasional vomiting. The abdominal pain was exacerbated by movements, such as rolling over, standing up, walking, and coughing. Injection of 1% xylocaine 10 ml at a trigger point of the right lateral region led to about 30% relief in pain. The patient was referred to an anesthesiologist for further evaluation and treatment, who performed transverse abdominal plane block and administered multiple analgesic medications (tramadol hydrochloride, pregabalin, celecoxib, and scopolamine butylbromide). These medications decreased the patient’s pain somewhat, and he reported that scopolamine butylbromide was most effective when the pain worsened. Because the patient’s symptoms were not relieved after trigger point treatment to the abdominal wall, we considered potential causes that might be associated with the location between the abdominal wall and visceral wall or related to other sources, including psychosocial, physiological, and other anatomical factors. We rechecked the abdominal CT scan for a suspected adhesion or abdominal hernia at the region of tenderness due to the prior surgical procedure, and we asked a radiologist to reevaluate the right upper abdomen in more detail. The radiologist confirmed a slight abnormality in the right upper abdomen and suggested the possibility of an adhesion around the surgical scar (Fig. ). We referred the patient to a gastrointestinal surgeon for laparoscopic evaluation and adhesiolysis. The patient underwent additional investigations, including cholecystocholangiography and colonoscopy for suspected postcholecystectomy syndrome, biliary dyskinesia, or colon abnormality. However, no cause of the abdominal pain was identified. On laparoscopic evaluation, a broad adhesion was observed. Adhesiolysis was performed 6 months after the patient first visited our hospital. Figure a shows adhesion between the peritoneum and omentum, liver, and ascending colon; Fig. b shows the condition after adhesiolysis. One month after adhesiolysis, the patient’s right abdomen pain level during movement improved from 8 to 2–3 on a pain scale. Therefore, he was able to move with less pain, and he did not feel pain when rolling over. The result of Carnett’s test was negative. After the patient started walking around his house, he felt abdominal pain about 5 minutes after walking. Hence, he was afraid of recurrence of abdominal pain and felt a little depressed and frustrated because he was unable to return to work early. We recommended a gradual increase in activity. He went on a trip 4 months after the operation without problems due to abdominal pain and then resumed his job 6 months after the operation.\nHowever, his abdominal pain deteriorated within 1 month after he resumed working. He presented with bleeding at the umbilicus, which was the laparoscopic port site, and abdominal incisional hernia was confirmed on the basis of CT. Repair of the abdominal incisional hernias and laparoscopic adhesiolysis were performed 8 months after the first operation. After the second operation, although it took time for some symptoms to improve because of surgical site infection, the patient’s symptoms were ultimately relieved, and he resumed his job again 5 months after undergoing the second operation. Although he reported mild abdominal pain and required analgesic medication, his weight decreased to 133 kg, and he was able to walk normally and work full-time, 2 years after he initially visited our hospital. The timeline of interventions and outcomes is shown in Additional file .","{

"A 26-year old woman presented with traumatic complete T5 paralysis for 2 years after suffering a T5 burst fracture caused by falling from a tree while hunting. T5 posterior fusion and decompression was performed to stabilize her, but the injury was complete with no return of function after 2 years. A baclofen pump was inserted into the L3 level for spasticity after few months of the injury. The severity of the injury was classified as grade A using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grading, which is defined as complete loss of motor and sensory functions below the level of the injury ().\nThe stimulator that was used in this study is approved by FDA for chronic pain treatment (). After obtaining informed consent from the patient, a total of 8 leads with 8 electrodes each were implanted at L2, L3, L4, and S1 bilaterally. Four leads for a total of 16 electrodes on each nerve root with two leads each were implanted at L5 bilaterally. The procedure was performed under general anesthetic with a small laminotomy at T12 to facilitate retrograde advancement and insertion of percutaneous leads to each level (). The procedure was done and guided under fluoroscopy and the total surgical time was ~120 min. A total of 2 batteries, with four ports each, were utilized connecting in the following configuration: 8 electrodes to D port for S1, 16 electrodes with a splitter to C port, 8 electrodes from L4 and 8 electrodes to L3 with a splitter to B port, and 8 electrodes to A port from L2. This allowed activating every other contact on each lead that is plugged in the splitter. Electrodes were then anchored into the interspinous ligament and tunneled to two separate gluteal pockets on either side. All electrodes from the left were sent to the left battery and right electrodes to the right battery. This procedure allowed for a total of 64 contact points, 32 per battery, on 12 leads with implantation of 96 electrodes that covered L2 to S1 bilaterally. Each lead hugged the posterolateral gutter of the spinal canal before exiting along with the nerve root out the respective foramen ().\nAfter recovery, the patient was sent home the same day, and allowed 1 week for healing. She was then brought to an outpatient setting. The device was programmed to send electrical signals through selected implanted electrodes. Those programs were numbered and linked to the movement of different muscle groups which can be controlled by the patient using a remote control. On the first day of using electrical stimulation, the stimulator was shown to raise her leg with full leg bending and extension movements (). Increases in muscle strength with stimuli were measured and results are shown in . Patient was also able to stand with stimuli and a weight-bearing device (Rifton Tram Lift) for a maximum of 54 s before fatigue in 60-min sessions with 8 trials.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Bilateral lower extremity edema', 'Progressive dyspnea on exertion'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousCondition': 'Presumed spinocerebellar ataxia'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'PET scan', 'Finding': 'Marked FDG avidity of anterior mediastinal mass'}, {'Test': 'Echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Severely dilated right atrium and right ventricle with interatrial septum bowing to the left'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Extranodal Rosai-Dorfman Disease', 'Type': 'Non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis', 'Location': 'Invasive mediastinal mass with near complete occlusion of pulmonary arteries'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Pulmonary artery stenting', 'Details': 'Stenting of right pulmonary artery to relieve occlusion and improve gradients'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Improved gradients and tolerated procedure well', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Pending further evaluation for definitive diagnosis and treatment'}}}"
"An 11-year-old boy visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of persistent right cheek pain. His family history revealed that his father had severe hearing impairment. His medical history showed that he had allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis that had been treated until 3 months previously by an otolaryngologist.\nThe patient initially visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling 6 weeks previously. A checkup at a dental clinic performed on the day before this initial visit revealed no abnormal findings. He showed clinical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal infection showed positive results. The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal infection. Facial cellulitis was also suspected and treatment with amoxicillin helped improve symptoms. However, facial pain recurred within 4 weeks of the initial visit. The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN. Subsequently, oral clarithromycin administration was initiated for sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. However, administration of clarithromycin for 1 week was not effective for his facial pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no neurovascular compression ( right), which ruled out idiopathic, classical TN. During this time, we interviewed the patient on the nature of the right cheek pain. The patient described the pain as persistent, nagging, and dull in nature, which was completely different from the characteristics of pain associated with TN. Furthermore, trigger maneuvers failed to evoke pain. These evaluations excluded TN, and, thus, PIFP was diagnosed in week 2. Low dose of oral anticonvulsant carbamazepine (50 mg, twice a day) was initiated but was ceased due to general fatigue after the first administration.\nAlthough the patient had been previously cheerful and greeted us when entering the examination room, he became gradually emotionless with headache and nausea in week 5. In addition, feeding difficulties and numbness in the arms occurred. An orthostatic tolerance test revealed no positive findings for orthostatic dysregulation. It became difficult for the patient to attend school in week 6. Because various somatic symptoms developed in addition to PIFP, psychological factors were suspected to be pertinent in the etiology of PIFP. During a detailed medical interview with the patient and his mother, several problems were revealed: the patient loved swimming but his swimming record had plateaued after fixing his swimming form even though he practiced vigorously at a top-class swimming club team. Moreover, because of a recent finger injury, he could not practice as intensely as he wanted; therefore, his competitive ability as a swimmer deteriorated. Furthermore, in early adolescence, the patient had difficulties in communication and his relationship with his father was strained due to the father's hearing impairment. Because these suggested that the circumstances surrounding him might have led to somatoform disorders, psychological counseling was ordered in week 6.\nAs the patient faced, understood, and tolerated his psychological stress through counseling and psychotherapy twice a week, he gradually became expressive, worked up his appetite, and could attend school in week 10. Although sinusitis recurred at week 29, no facial pain developed. The patient received psychological counseling twice or thrice a month by this time. After 8 months, the frequency of counseling was reduced to once in 2 months. During this period, the patient's voice changed and became deeper at puberty. After confirming that facial pain as well as general malaise did not occur, even when the patient experienced distressing events, such as terminal examinations, counseling was ceased after 1 year and 8 months. After 3 years, the patient went on to high school and currently attends school cheerfully without any complaints and has resumed swimming.","{

"A 9-year-old boy had presented with frequent pneumonia. He was born vaginally at 25 weeks and 6 days at home due to an unknown reason. His birth weight was 750 g. He was in cardiopulmonary arrest when he arrived at the previous hospital. Resuscitation was performed immediately on arrival. Peritoneal drainage was performed because gastric perforation was found soon after resuscitation. Thereafter, a diagnosis of TEF was made, and gastrostomy was created in the previous hospital. He was transferred to our institution at 28 days of age. He was diagnosed as having an EA with a distal TEF (Gross C), and the primary repair of the EA with fistula division was performed at our hospital when he was 5 months of age. The postoperative course was uneventful, and gastrostomy was closed at 10 months of age. He discharged at 2 year of age. After his discharge, severe epilepsy and encephalopathy due to encephalitis occurred, and he became disabled with severe mental retardation at the age of 2. He could not feed orally. At the age of 3, he underwent Nissen fundoplication and re-gastrostomy because of gastroesophageal reflux and hiatus hernia. At the time of the operation, subglottic stenosis was suspected because he could only be intubated with a tracheal tube of 2.5 mm in diameter.\nSix months after fundoplication, a recurrence of hiatus hernia was found, which involved the herniation of the stomach and small and large intestine into the thoracic cavity. A reoperation to repair the herniation was not performed because the patient had been in stable condition. However, he had been suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections since he was 7 years of age. In addition, severe bronchial asthma worsened his respiratory symptoms. At 9 years of age, he was referred to our hospital again because of frequent pneumonia.\nA CT scan revealed the herniation of the large and small intestine into the thoracic cavity; we were therefore of the opinion that they should be pulled down into the abdominal cavity in order to resolve the patient’s respiratory problems (Fig. ). We thought that we should perform tracheotomy or laryngotracheal separation before repairing the recurrent hiatus hernia because the patient presented with severe dysphagia as well as severe hiatus hernia. An upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopy were performed to evaluate the esophagus and stomach, revealing the presence of residual gastroesophageal reflux and an elevated esophagus due to the recurrent hiatus hernia.\nAt 10 years of age, tracheotomy was performed. However, the patient’s respiratory status did not improve; thus, we performed laryngotracheal separation 6 weeks later. Three weeks after the laryngotracheal separation, a small volume of nutritional supplement, which had been administered via gastrostomy, was aspirated from the tracheotomy. We therefore suspected the recurrence of TEF. Under general anesthesia, both esophagography and endoscopy were performed again. The anastomotic line of the esophagus was located in the cervical area, 15 cm from the incisors. A pit was identified just beside the anastomotic line (Fig. ). Indigo carmine injected from the catheter placed in the pit revealed that the recurrent fistula was located in the trachea (Fig. ). In addition, the anastomosis line of EA was thought to have been elevated to the cervical area due to the recurrence of the hiatus hernia.\nThus, the repair of the recurrent TEF was performed through the right cervical approach. It was impossible to place a catheter or guide wire through the TEF. After the separation of the esophagus and trachea, the small hole of the fistula was found and closed (Fig. ). At the site of the fistula, the esophagus and trachea had a “common wall” due to severe adhesion around the fistula. A sternothyroid muscle flap was interposed between the closure sites (Fig. ). After the operation, the respiratory symptoms of the patient improved dramatically. Three months after the repair of the recurrent TEF, the recurrent hiatus hernia was surgically treated. The postoperative course was also uneventful. The patient remains well at 2 years after the surgical repair of the recurrent TEF. There is no evidence of the further recurrence of TEF or hiatus hernia.\nWe experienced a relatively rare case of recurrent TEF that was found 10 years after the initial repair. We herein discuss the reason why the recurrent TEF had not been identified and the surgical technique that we used to repair the patient’s recurrent TEF.\nThe patient had subglottic stenosis, which made it difficult to observe the trachea. In addition to the subglottic stenosis, both bronchial asthma and recurrent hiatus hernia were thought to have caused the patient’s respiratory symptoms due to frequent pneumonia. These factors may have caused the patient’s recurrent TEF to remain unidentified. Recurrence was first suspected when a small volume of nutritional supplement that had been administered via gastrostomy was aspirated from the tracheostomy tube after the laryngotracheal separation. In general, although many cases of recurrent TEF are diagnosed by a contrast study, some require further examination by endoscopy with or without a dye test [, , , ]. In the present case, bronchoscopy (which is safer and precise) was not possible prior to tracheostomy due to the patient’s subglottic stenosis. As shown in Fig. , esophagoscopy and bronchoscopy combined with a dye test enabled us to diagnose the recurrent TEF.\nIn general, almost all patients with recurrent TEF have episodes of leakage and/or tracheal injuries [–, ]. The recurrent fistula usually opens in the trachea at the site of the original fistula site or tracheal injury [–]. In this case, there was no leakage or tracheal injury at the site of the primary repair. In contrast with other cases, the site of recurrence was found to be high in the cervical area. Thus, we suspected that the patient had both proximal and distal tracheoesophageal fistula (gross type D), and the upper pouch fistula was missed in the primary operation [, ]. However, as shown in Fig. , a pit was identified just beside the anastomotic line. The anastomotic line in the esophagus had shifted to the cervical area because of the recurrent hiatus hernia. We therefore judged that the original fistula (proximal tracheoesophageal fistula of gross type D) in the upper pouch was not found at this time. We also suspected that the trachea had been injured during laryngotracheal separation. However, during the repair of the recurrent TEF, the fistula was found to be located in an area that had not been touched during the laryngotracheal separation. Based on the above-noted findings, we diagnosed the patient with recurrent TEF.\nIn the present case, the TEF might have recurred at the age of 9, when the patient started suffering from frequent and severe pneumonia. The recurrent hiatus hernia caused GER and the poor clearance of refluxed gastric juice in the esophagus. Prolonged acid contact causing inflammation and erosion around the anastomotic site is thought to have been important in the pathogenesis of TEF in the present case.\nThere are several options for repairing recurrent TEF. Endoscopic techniques using adhesives have been presented [–]. This method is reported to be effective when the fistula tract is first de-epithelialized using several types of devices and then fibrin glue or a similar agent is injected into the tract of the fistula [, –]. However, it is thought that this technique would have been difficult in the present case because the tract was not detected clearly and because it was not possible to place a catheter under endoscopy. We therefore opted for open surgical closure. The placement of viable tissue between the suture lines may help to prevent the further recurrence of TEF [, , , ]. Previous studies have described the use of the pericardium, pleura, intercostal flap, cervical muscle flap, cartilage, and lymph nodes for this purpose [, , , ]. The flap can be harvested from the same surgical site with its own blood supply. In the present case, a sternothyroid muscle flap was chosen because the recurrent fistula was in the cervical area. In fact, in the present case, the muscle flap was easily and safely interposed between the divided ends of the fistula with a good blood supply. Based on our experience, the interposition of a muscle flap using the sternothyroid muscle is thought to be a good option for reoperation to repair a recurrent TEF in the cervical area.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaint of a back mass with recent onset of dull pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousHistory': ['Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Hypercholesterolemia', 'Overweight BMI (29.1)']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Physical Examination', 'Finding': 'Soft, mobile, non-reducible mass approximately 5 cm in diameter located on the right scapular line below the costal margin'}, {'Test': 'CT Scan', 'Finding': '5-6 cm right upper lumbar hernia sac containing retroperitoneal fat with a 1.6 cm fascial defect'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Grynfeltt-Lesshaft Lumbar Hernia', 'Type': 'Hernia', 'Location': 'Upper lumbar triangle'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Hernia repair surgery', 'Details': 'Placement of polypropylene mesh patch and closure of fascial defect'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No recurrences or complications noted on six-month follow-up', 'DischargeStatus': 'Patient discharged same day'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No complications or recurrences'}}}"
"A 47-year-old woman presented with a complaint of generalized right knee pain. Physical examination of the right knee joint revealed nothing remarkable. The patient had a history of chronic alcohol consumption exceeding 400 mL of ethanol per week for the past 20 years. There was no history of steroid intake or trauma. One year before presentation, she had undergone a bipolar hip replacement for avascular necrosis of the left hip. She referred to our hospital due to the right knee pain. Radiographs revealed no destruction of the articular surfaces of the right knee, but increased radiodensity was evident in the proximal half of the tibia extending from the joint line (). MRI demonstrated large demarcated regions of abnormal signal intensity in the proximal half of the tibia and medial femoral condyle, with features of osteonecrosis (). A bone scintigram showed the abnormal uptake in the right hip, and the right and the left knee joints (Figures , , and ). A full blood screen including autoantibodies, a clotting profile, ALP, and AMY gave normal results (). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C viruses and antibodies were negative. The patient complained that she had often felt mild pain in her right hip and left knee joint after a short walk. Physical examination of the right hip and left knee revealed no abnormality. However, radiographs demonstrated increased radiolucency in both, and MRI revealed demarcated regions of abnormal signal intensity in the central portion of the right femoral head with typical features of osteonecrosis (). Left knee MRI showed multiple demarcated bone marrow abnormalities with double-line sign in the distal shaft of the left femur, compatible with bone necrosis ().\nThe patient was instructed to maintain only partial weight-bearing with wheelchair mobilization for eight weeks and then to return gradually to full weight-bearing over the next two months. Eleven months after the initial presentation, she complained of mild pain in her right hip. Plain radiograph revealed the collapse of her right femoral head. A bipolar hip arthroplasty was performed on the right side. A biopsy of the femoral head confirmed the diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Thereafter, no symptoms were evident in both knee joints. Abstinence from alcohol was also achieved successfully.","{

"A 77-year-old female presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a three-year history of an extremely sensitive small mass on her right wrist. The mass had subjectively grown over this period of time. The pain had progressively worsened over time, and she had developed significant hypersensitivity to light contact. There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel’s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. At her first postoperative visit, she reported no pain and that she was very satisfied with the results of her surgery. Diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin (Figures , ).","{

"This case presents a 38-year-old Asian G2P1001 female who delivered by cesarean section (CS) at 32 weeks gestation for pre-eclampsia with severe features with uncontrollable blood pressures. Her pregnancy was further complicated by a known right ovarian mass, history of endometriosis which was managed conservatively, as well as infertility. Both first and second pregnancies were conceived via in vitro fertilization by frozen embryo transfer. Her first pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated, however resulted in primary CS for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing. No pelvic pathology was noted during that CS. The patient was first diagnosed with a right ovarian mass during her second pregnancy while on IVF treatment. The patient declined the option of removing the mass due to possibility of damaging the nearby ovarian tissue during removal of the mass and thus worsening her infertility. The IVF treatment was successful. The transvaginal ultrasonography performed during the early pregnancy suspected the right ovarian mass as endometrioma or desmoid tumor ().\nThe mass was kept under surveillance by performing periodic ultrasound imaging. Due to the change in mass characteristics and increase in size, the patient was referred to a Gynecologic Oncologist during second trimester. Considering the high risk pregnancy, recommendation was made to follow the mass with sequential ultrasound with the removal of the mass at the time of repeat CS as long as the mass did not change in size or configuration during the pregnancy and patient remained asymptomatic. Unfortunately, the patient developed pre-eclampsia with severe features at 32 weeks of gestation. Upon admission, she was given magnesium sulfate infusion for seizure prophylaxis and corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity. The Maternal-Fetal-Medicine specialists recommended delivery at thirty-four weeks of gestation unless there were new signs of maternal or fetal instability. However, three days after the admission, she underwent an emergency cesarean section due to recurrent severe blood pressure changes which were unresponsive to intravenous antihypertensive medications.\nDuring cesarean section, extensive adhesions were noted at the level of adipose tissue, rectus muscle, and anterior surface of the uterus, which were densely adhered to each other and to the anterior abdominal wall. With limited visualization of the lower uterine segment, a classical vertical uterine incision was performed. The fetus was delivered without difficulty. The uterus was exteriorized and closed in layers. At this point, the right ovarian mass was visualized, the surface of which was friable and hemorrhagic. Two units of each packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate were administered. Antibiotics were re-dosed due to prolonged surgical time. With extensive lysis of adhesions and uterine packing, the surgeons successfully ligated the uterine pedicle and the infundibulopelvic ligament to remove the large ovarian mass.\nThe pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed an ovarian mass with attached intact fallopian tube, weighing 63 g and measuring 14.0 × 10.5 × 3.0 cm ().\nThe external surface of ovarian mass was smooth, hemorrhagic but without any excrescences. The serial sectioning revealed multiple cystic lesions filled with clear to yellow fluid as well as necrotic material overall occupying 80% of the ovarian mass. Microscopically, the viable ovarian tissue demonstrated tubulocystic and papillary architecture along with focal areas of solid sheets of tumor cells displaying the clear cytoplasm.

"A 65-year-old man with no medical history was transferred from another hospital because of pain in the right side of chin and ear. He complained of frequent paroxysms of severe stabbing pain in the right side of his mandible radiating to the right ear. His pain either occurred spontaneously or was triggered by chewing and tooth brushing and lasted few seconds in each pain attack. He had experienced the pain since 5 months ago. The patient was diagnosed as TN at another hospital and was prescribed carbamazepine (200 mg a day) with only partial relief of the pain. He had a pain-free period for about 1 month before visiting our clinic and stopped medication on his own decision. In the last few days prior to the admission, his condition had got worse in terms of increase of frequency and severity of pain. He visited our clinic because of intractable pain even with medications.\nThe routine laboratory tests and electrocardiogram were normal. Neurological and nasopharyngeal assessments were normal findings. Computed tomography of the neck and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed also normal. His symptoms were fulfilled in the diagnostic criteria of TN [].\nHis pain paroxysms had occurred four or five times daily with 100 of visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 is no pain and 100 is imaginary the worst pain) at the first visit. The duration of pain attacks was measured in a few seconds. He underwent mandibular nerve block with alcohol after the test block with 1% of mepivacaine. He still complained of right ear pain even though right V3 innervated area was anesthetized and pain free after the V3 alcohol block. Ten minutes after the procedure, paroxysmal pain in right ear developed and he experienced faintness and got loss of consciousness with convulsive movement for about 1 minute. He was consulted with a neurologist to exclude seizure disorders. Electroencephalogram showed no abnormalities. Brain MRI was not able to be performed due to convulsive movement during the pain attack.\nHe was consulted to a cardiologist. His echocardiogram was normal, however, bradycardia followed by asystole during pain attacks was revealed in the continuous electrocardiography. The duration of bradycardia and asystole was in proportion to duration of pain attack. According to a careful asking about the pain characters following the V3 block with alcohol, he presented that his pain occurred in the soft palate, uvula and throat and was triggered by swallowing or mechanical stimulation of the right side of the pharynx. Bradycardia and asystole accompanied with sometimes seizure-like activity occurred always with pain attack. Based on his altered pain characters and cardiac symptoms with no specific etiology originated from heart, he was diagnosed of GPN associated with asystole.\nCarbamazepine (100 mg twice a day) was started for control of pain as well as asystole. Regardless of increasing dose of carbamazepine up to 400 mg a day, severe bradycarida, asystole and syncope preceded by paroxysmal pain continued four to five times in one hour. A temporary cardiac pacemaker was implanted via left subclavian vein by a cardiologist to prevent cerebral ischemia during asystole. Although syncope and seizure-like activity disappeared after the insertion of a temporary pacemaker, intensity or frequency of pain in the throat and ear was unchanged. Carbamazepine increased up to 600 mg a day to reach pain control for 4 days after the implantation of temporary cardiac pacemaker. On the 5 day of hospitalization, he underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker to prevent bradycardia and asystole by a cardiologist. He was achieved pain free and no cardiac symptoms after the implantation of permanent pacemaker with daily 600 mg of carbamazepine and has maintained symptom free condition for 4 months of follow-up.","{

"A 77-year-old female presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a three-year history of an extremely sensitive small mass on her right wrist. The mass had subjectively grown over this period of time. The pain had progressively worsened over time, and she had developed significant hypersensitivity to light contact. There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel’s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. At her first postoperative visit, she reported no pain and that she was very satisfied with the results of her surgery. Diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin (Figures , ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Generalized abdominal pain localizing to the right with nausea and loss of appetite', 'Tenderness in right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa with rebound and guarding'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No history of recent or past trauma'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal X-ray', 'Finding': 'Absence of gas in the right side of the bowel'}, {'Test': 'Chest X-ray', 'Finding': 'No obvious abnormality'}, {'Test': 'CT thorax and abdomen', 'Finding': ""Bilateral pleural effusions with unexpanded lungs, large Reidl's lobe, absence of right hemidiaphragm""}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Diaphragmatic hernia with appendicitis', 'Type': 'Surgical condition', 'Location': 'Right hemidiaphragm, intrathoracic space'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Exploratory laparoscopy, laparotomy, appendicectomy', 'Details': 'Reducing contents of hernial sac, fixing caecum in right iliac fossa'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good recovery, relief of abdominal symptoms', 'DischargeStatus': 'Patient discharged a week post-operatively'}}}"
"A 21-year-old female who presented to our outpatient clinic with complaints of pain and swelling in her left knee for 8 months before her first visit, with a sudden increase in size for later 2 months. On examination of her limb, there was gross wasting of quadriceps muscle with diffuse swelling over the lateral aspect of the distal thigh measuring approximately 12 cm long and 5 cm across. The local temperature was raised with tenderness on deep palpation restricting terminal knee flexion. On anteroposterior and lateral Roentgenogram, there was an eccentric lytic and sclerotic lesion in the left distal end femur with a narrow zone of transition without evidence of joint involvement, with some areas of soft-tissue calcification and minimal periosteal reaction. Core biopsy done reported to have cellular tissues with multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells admixed with mononuclear cells, round to oval to spindle-shaped without significant cellular atypia and histological diagnosis of GCT was made.\nThe patient was lost to follow up, presented 3 months later with an enlarged mass measuring 15 cm x 12 cm with ulceration over the lateral aspect of the knee (). New AP and the lateral radiograph showed a large destructive lesion in the distal femur with chondroid matrix, broad zone of transition with break-in cortex, and destruction of joint margin, fresh magnetic resonance images showed a heterogeneous mass of the left distal femur with the erosion of joint margin extending about 15 cm from the joint line without involvement of femoral or popliteal vessels and nerves. CT scan of the chest was found to be normal. A final diagnosis of fungating non-metastatic giant cell tumor of the left distal femur, Campanacci Grade III with the left knee joint involvement was made.\nManagement options were explored, preferably to excise the tumor and reconstruct the limb to provide the functional ability, and the decision of wide excision with endoprosthesis application was made. Intraoperatively, careful dissection was done protecting the neurovascular bundle and the tumor was removed preventing any soft-tissue spillage. After confirmation of the safe margin through the frozen section examination, distal femoral endoprosthesis was cemented (). The post-operative specimen had features of GCT without atypia with safe bony and soft-tissue margins. The patient was put on protected weight-bearing initially, slowly progressing to full weight-bearing along with knee range of movement and quadriceps strengthening exercises. At follow-up of 2 years with extensive physical therapy, the patient has good functional results with flexion of 90° () and is walking without pain enabling her to carry on comfortably with routine activities. No evidence of infection or local recurrence was seen.","{

"A 66-year-old female patient was admitted with the diagnosis of an approximately 10 cm painless and immobile mass between the clavicle and the chin on the right side of the neck. A vascular mass originating from the carotid body was detected in ultrasonography and a tomography was performed. In sagittal and axial image of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), a solid lesion in the right carotid area was detected that pushes the internal and external carotid artery and jugular vein; it was approximately 80 mm×90 mm×100 mm in size, with smooth contours and well-circumscribed, intense contrast enhancement (). Embolization was decided before curative surgery as the large diameter of the mass made it difficult for dissection due to compression on surrounding nerves, and dense collaterals that could cause bleeding. Digital subtraction angiography was depicted that the lesion was fed with multiple collaterals originating from the external and internal carotid arteries and the lesion was suitable for embolization (). In embolization, following the right external and internal carotid artery selective catheterization, all the feeding arteries emerging from these vessels were entered one by one and the vessels belonging to the tumor were tried to be closed with Onyx® glue-cast particles (an adhesive liquid embolic agent) under general anesthesia and subtracted fluoroscopic monitoring. Particles were introduced slowly by continuous fluoroscopy to prevent the backflow of particles. The procedure resulted in a significant decrease in blood flow and the tumor was observed to shrink in digital subtraction angiography (). No complications were noted to occur during and after the procedure. Neck contrast-enhanced CT performed after embolization showed that the intense contrast enhancement decreased, the carotid artery branches became prominent and their arching decreased in coronal and axial images (). The carotid body tumor in our case was type II, as per the classification made by Shamblin et al. Two days after embolization, the patient was taken to surgery for curative tumor excision. The tumor was dissected without damaging the internal carotid artery, and it was removed completely (). After the tumor was removed, the anatomical structure of the carotid artery became fully visible (). During the operation, residual arterial tortuous structures were seen around the left nervus vagus; all of these vascular structures were dissected while protecting the nerve. There was no nerve damage. The patient had mild swallowing difficulty in the postoperative period; however, it improved after 1 month, without recurrence.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain, swelling, and erythematous changes in the anterolateral aspect of the left leg'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Tibial plateau fracture with sciatic nerve injury, distal femur fracture, femoral artery rupture'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographs 10 years ago', 'Finding': 'Large, fusiform-shaped radiopaque soft tissue mass between tibia and fibula'}, {'Test': 'Radiographs 10 years later', 'Finding': 'Large, fusiform-shaped soft tissue mass with extensive plaque-like and amorphous calcifications'}, {'Test': 'CT Scan', 'Finding': 'Peripherally distributed calcification in anterior compartment and deep posterior compartment'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Calcific Myonecrosis', 'Type': 'Soft tissue disorder', 'Location': 'Anterior and deep posterior compartments of the left leg'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Extensive debridement of anterior and deep posterior compartments', 'Details': 'En-block resection, drain tube insertion, antibiotic treatment'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Delayed wound healing, no recurrence', 'DischargeStatus': 'Satisfied with result'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Satisfied with result of operation'}}}"
"The Radiology Department requested an emergency surgical consultation for an 84-year-old male patient with sudden lower abdominal discomfort and pain during a diagnostic barium enema. The enema had been scheduled and administered as diagnostic tool for the evaluation of his chronic constipation. The patient had been referred to his gastroenterologist due to a history of obscure chronic constipation for more than 10 years. Although the patient had been consulted for a diagnostic colonoscopy, due to his lack of consent, the procedure had been canceled, and he was then scheduled for a diagnostic barium enema. The enema had been done using a 28F plastic rectal tube, followed by rectal infusion of 96% barium-sulfate solution at a pressure of 100 centimeters of water.\nIn our first emergent visit, the patient complained of a vague pain in his lower abdomen, which had started immediately following the rectal tube's insertion. He believed that the pain had increased during the procedure. Except for a history of chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, we found no other previous medical or surgical condition in the patient. He was totally conscious with stable and normal vital signs. Physical examination revealed a generalized abdominal tenderness mostly presented in lower quadrants in addition to insignificant rebound tenderness in the hypogastric region. Digital rectal exam showed a loose, bloody stool. An emergent supine plain abdominal x-ray was taken to evaluate the pattern of the administered barium within the abdomen (). The pattern of contrast extravasation in the x-ray reinforced the possibility of rectal perforation and spillage of the contrast into the surrounding tissues.\nAfter an adequate fluid replacement, resuscitation and prophylactic antibiotics, with the diagnosis of rectal perforation and barium extravasation, the patient underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a midline incision. The laparotomy revealed no site of visible perforation in the distal colon or the sigmoid and upper rectum, but bright drops of barium were detected on the posterior wall of the peritoneum and around the sigmoid mesocolon and the mesoileum (). It seemed that the barium had penetrated from its initial location in retroperitoneum into the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite the adhesive characteristic of barium and its deep penetration into tissues, barium drops were extracted as much as possible, after which a massive irrigation and lavage of the peritoneal cavity was done. A diverting ileostomy was also performed to divert the fecal stream from the distal rectum that was the major site of injury. A tissue sample was also taken from the mesenteric tissue to confirm the possible etiology of peritoneal inflammation. Microscopic evaluation of the sample depicted a fat necrosis and foreign-body reaction within the tissues.\nFollowing the surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were administered. Despite the proper hydration and the administration of antibiotics, signs and symptoms of sepsis gradually developed within the next two days. Thereafter, the patient underwent a rigid proctoscopy, which showed a massive inflammation and blood clots on the posterior wall of the rectum. In order to provide a better drainage system for the presacral space, we also accomplished an open, corrugated, presacral drain.\nAlthough, with close monitoring and proper medication, the general condition of the patient improved and the sepsis was resolved in a period of 10 days following the last procedure, a generalized abdominal pain developed gradually after 14 days. A high fever was also detected. In order to find possible sources of localized infection, such as abscesses within the injured sites, we performed an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. The scan demonstrated an extensive hyperdense area within the retroperitoneal space on left side of the pelvis, with an extension to the psoas muscles (). A second laparotomy was performed at that time. During this procedure, a massive dissemination of barium up to the inferior pole of both kidneys was found. The mesentery of the colon and small intestine was covered by barium, and the retroperitoneal tissues were highly fragile and inflamed. In addition to a proper irrigation, a meticulous, but massive, debridement of necrotic tissues within the retroperitoneal area was performed. Two open, corrugated drains were also inserted.\nAfter a week, the patient had stable vital signs. The fever had disappeared, and he had regained his appetite. Both the presacral and the abdominal drains were removed, and the patient began an oral diet gradually. Finally, the patient was discharged after 10 days with a generally good and stable condition. He was also referred to the stoma care center for further support. Thereafter, he was asked to visit with his surgical team on a biweekly basis. Four months later, the diversion ileostomy was closed, and he was advised to do monthly and then bimonthly visits. He had regained his normal life at that time. After two years of postoperative follow-up, he is in very good condition, but his x-rays still show the presence of barium in his retroperitoneal space ().","{

"An 11-year-old boy visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of persistent right cheek pain. His family history revealed that his father had severe hearing impairment. His medical history showed that he had allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis that had been treated until 3 months previously by an otolaryngologist.\nThe patient initially visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling 6 weeks previously. A checkup at a dental clinic performed on the day before this initial visit revealed no abnormal findings. He showed clinical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal infection showed positive results. The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal infection. Facial cellulitis was also suspected and treatment with amoxicillin helped improve symptoms. However, facial pain recurred within 4 weeks of the initial visit. The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN. Subsequently, oral clarithromycin administration was initiated for sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. However, administration of clarithromycin for 1 week was not effective for his facial pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no neurovascular compression ( right), which ruled out idiopathic, classical TN. During this time, we interviewed the patient on the nature of the right cheek pain. The patient described the pain as persistent, nagging, and dull in nature, which was completely different from the characteristics of pain associated with TN. Furthermore, trigger maneuvers failed to evoke pain. These evaluations excluded TN, and, thus, PIFP was diagnosed in week 2. Low dose of oral anticonvulsant carbamazepine (50 mg, twice a day) was initiated but was ceased due to general fatigue after the first administration.\nAlthough the patient had been previously cheerful and greeted us when entering the examination room, he became gradually emotionless with headache and nausea in week 5. In addition, feeding difficulties and numbness in the arms occurred. An orthostatic tolerance test revealed no positive findings for orthostatic dysregulation. It became difficult for the patient to attend school in week 6. Because various somatic symptoms developed in addition to PIFP, psychological factors were suspected to be pertinent in the etiology of PIFP. During a detailed medical interview with the patient and his mother, several problems were revealed: the patient loved swimming but his swimming record had plateaued after fixing his swimming form even though he practiced vigorously at a top-class swimming club team. Moreover, because of a recent finger injury, he could not practice as intensely as he wanted; therefore, his competitive ability as a swimmer deteriorated. Furthermore, in early adolescence, the patient had difficulties in communication and his relationship with his father was strained due to the father's hearing impairment. Because these suggested that the circumstances surrounding him might have led to somatoform disorders, psychological counseling was ordered in week 6.\nAs the patient faced, understood, and tolerated his psychological stress through counseling and psychotherapy twice a week, he gradually became expressive, worked up his appetite, and could attend school in week 10. Although sinusitis recurred at week 29, no facial pain developed. The patient received psychological counseling twice or thrice a month by this time. After 8 months, the frequency of counseling was reduced to once in 2 months. During this period, the patient's voice changed and became deeper at puberty. After confirming that facial pain as well as general malaise did not occur, even when the patient experienced distressing events, such as terminal examinations, counseling was ceased after 1 year and 8 months. After 3 years, the patient went on to high school and currently attends school cheerfully without any complaints and has resumed swimming.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain, swelling, and erythematous changes in the anterolateral aspect of the left leg'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Tibial plateau fracture with sciatic nerve injury, distal femur fracture with femoral artery rupture'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographs', 'Finding': 'Large, fusiform-shaped soft tissue mass with extensive plaque-like and amorphous calcifications'}, {'Test': 'CT Scan', 'Finding': 'Peripherally distributed calcification in the anterior and deep posterior compartments'}, {'Test': 'Laboratory Investigations', 'Finding': 'ESR 69 mm/h, CRP 5.80 mg/dL, normal calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase levels'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Calcific Myonecrosis', 'Type': 'Soft tissue disorder', 'Location': 'Anterior and deep posterior compartments of the left leg'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Extensive debridement of anterior and deep posterior compartments', 'Details': 'Intraoperative removal of necrotic muscles and calcific materials, antibiotic treatment, primary closure'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Delayed wound healing, no recurrence at 2-year follow-up', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient satisfied with the result of the operation'}}}"
"A 59-year-old female initially presented to the emergency department 10 months prior with right arm pain and swelling. A computed tomography of the neck with contrast at the time showed two confluent masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions encasing the right subclavian and axillary vein, the internal mammary artery, and narrowing of the lower internal jugular vein. Patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient was evaluated by the oncology and radiation oncology services and underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Her course of chemotherapy was complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. Gradually, her pain of the right upper extremity worsened, and the patient was started on opioid therapy. Despite titration of her oral medications to extended release morphine 90 mg two times a day, immediate release morphine 30 mg every 2 to 3 hours, methadone 5 mg daily, and gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, her pain control remained suboptimal. She was referred to our pain clinic for further management of her intractable pain.\nOn presentation, the patient reported a constant 10/10 pain on the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) of the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. The pain was reported as dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature. Her pain was worsened by passive and active range of motion, and the pain at its best was a 7/10 with oral medications. Patient also reported progressive weakness of the entire right upper extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus was obtained, and the study revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus at the level of the divisions and cords as well as the right brachial artery ().\nDiagnostic brachial plexus block was performed in the hospital due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain. The brachial plexus was unable to be visualized using ultrasonography in the classic supraclavicular area due to the tumor effect, thus the block was performed at the level of the trunks using a lower interscalene approach. 18 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected under direct ultrasound guidance. The patient reported complete pain relief lasting approximately 12 hours after the nerve block. Given the success of the diagnostic nerve block, the patient was offered the option of chemical neurolytic brachial plexus block with an extensive discussion of the unique risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient elected to proceed to a right brachial plexus nerve block with dehydrated ethanol.","{

"This is a case of 11-year-old boy, who has a history of fall from the sixth floor and sustained severe traumatic brain injury when he was at 4 years of age. During trauma screening including CT brain, he was found to have multiple brain contusions and an incidental finding of extensive optic glioma. After that, an MRI brain showed that the optic glioma was very extensive in the brain parenchyma, to the point it was extending from both optic nerves through the optic chiasm and to the whole optic pathways bilaterally (). Moreover, it was extending to intraventricular system and to the sella and suprasellar region. Patient was managed and treated in the paediatric intensive care unit with conservative treatment for the head injury. The patient ended up with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 8/15.\nDue to his poor neurological status, with this extensive optic glioma, it was decided by paediatric neuro-oncology tumour board that there is no further treatment that can be offered to him. During his follow-up, he was found to have a significant increase in his head circumference which reached up to 74 cm. The brain MRI was repeated and showed progression of the tumour size and the hydrocephalus; therefore, a VP shunt was inserted. After 4 months, the VP shunt was complicated by recurrent abdominal ascites due to scarring from previous abdominal exploratory surgery, and high protein in the CSF. This required us to do multiple revisions and tapping of the abdominal ascites by inserting a peg tail. At this point, he failed the management of multiple VP shunt revisions.\nCSF protein was found most of the time to be more than 20 g/L, and he was required to have frequent periodic ascitic tapping almost every 3 weeks. Because of the high protein content of the CSF, other cavities for shunt placement were excluded. For example, pleural cavity was excluded to avoid pleural effusion and cardiac atrium was excluded to avoid thrombosis. Also, the brain endoscopic surgeries like ETV was excluded due to tumour location in the lateral ventricles, anterior, and posterior part of the third ventricle (). After all these factors, we decided to proceed with VG shunt. An ultrasound of the gallbladder was done, which represented a sludge in the gallbladder; however, there were no signs of inflammation or biliary dilatation. Laparoscopic insertion of VG shunt was established through inserting the distal end of the VP shunt into the gallbladder fundus with irrigation of the gallbladder using normal saline to clean it from the sludge. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no difficulties. Evaluation of the VG shunt patency has been done by a nuclear medicine study called a shunt patency test. In this test, a radiotracer was injected into the shunt reservoir and we measured the flow of CSF in the shunt and valves. The test showed that the radiotracer filled the gallbladder and after giving the patient a meal, the gallbladder contracted and the transit of the radiotracer activity was seen in the bowel loops, which indicated the patency of the VG shunt (). After 5 weeks of VG shunt placement, the patient presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of fever, shortness of breath and presence of jaundice on examination.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Neck and thoracic spinal pain', 'Headache'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastIllness': 'Shingles in 2004'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Xiphodynia', 'Type': 'Functional disorder', 'Location': 'Xiphoid process'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and ultrasound therapy', 'Details': 'Four treatments of LLLT for 2 minutes each followed by ultrasound therapy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Symptoms subsided from 8/10 to 2-3/10', 'DischargeStatus': 'Continued conservative care'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Mild and intermittent symptoms, opted for no examination or treatment at this time'}}}"
"The second patient (P2) was a 30-year old female with headache (TTH or migraine) several days a week. She was living with her boyfriend and working in primary care clinic. The patient had experienced headaches since she was a little girl and had migraine since she was 15 years old. She had tried lots of medication and had at last found one medicine that had at least some effect – if taken early it could stop an oncoming migraine attack.\nAccording to the baseline data, she had headaches every other day with intensity varying from low to very high ( and ) and sometimes she could not tell if it was migraine, TTH, or something else. The patient had marks around her tongue indicating that she had behavior of pressing her tongue against the teeth. She had negative thoughts about the headache destroying her daily life and became stressed from having headache. The patient did not exercise regularly although she thought she should. This made her feel unsatisfied with herself. She was taking her migraine medicine several times a week (), more often than she thought was healthy. Her perception of disability and feelings of loss of happiness were highly varying depending on how much headache she had (). She had a low self-efficacy for managing her headaches ().\nThere were several behaviors that were supposed to contribute to her headaches, which led to several intertwined FBAs. Contracting her muscles of shoulders, neck, and jaw was a behavioral response primarily in situations when she felt psychological stress. This physical reaction was hypothesized to be a conditioned response to situations that resembled earlier stressful situations and thereby occurred more frequently. She perceived the stress in situations when she was feeling not in control, often because of not only headache but also work-related tasks. Automatic negative thoughts were common in these situations. The consequence was tension and headache and even more stress of not being in control, which positively reinforced her automatic negative thoughts. Her feeling of anxiety for getting headaches was also in close connection with psychological stress. This behavior had the antecedent of knowing that it would not be a good time for having headache, for example, when she knew that she had important things to do that would be difficult to call off. Her low self-efficacy for managing her headaches was thought to be an important factor for maintaining the behavior of physical tension, automatic negative thoughts, and feelings of anxiety.\nSometimes her headache or fear of headache made her take migraine medicine. This operant response had the short-term positive reinforcing consequence of a feeling that she had done something to prevent the worst scenario of migraine headache. At the same time, it made her in the long run feel even less in control over her headache and worried that the medicine would not be healthy and that she would get even more headache from taking them.\nAnother behavior targeted was her physical activity level. Her headaches made her tired and she was not able to be physically active as much as she would like to. She had tried to go to classes at the gym. If she had a headache when she started, the consequence would often be worse headache afterward, a punishment that made it difficult for her to plan the activities. In the long run, her low physical activity might lead to more physical and psychological stress and more headache.\nIn summary, the interrelationship of stress and headache was obvious, and her feeling of not being in control was important for maintaining her behaviors. The short-term goals were that she would feel that she had tools to break behavioral chains earlier and, for example, start to do her exercises instead of getting tense when she felt worried. The long-term goal was set to a maximum of headache 2 days per week.\nThe treatment consisted of 14 visits with home exercises in between, including baseline and follow-up visits.\nBasic targeted physical skills were to learn to activate the deep muscles of the neck and to increase the endurance and blood circulation of neck and shoulder muscles in order to be able to control muscle tension. Cognitive basic targeted skills were to recognize negative thoughts, be aware of the reasons for taking medication, and to use support from her boyfriend to be physically active. Applied skills were better posture in everyday activities, to recognize and replace negative thoughts in activities, questioning medication intake, and to be physically active on a regular basis.\nFirst focus was set on physical skills (i.e., muscular endurance and posture), then cognitive skills (i.e., negative thoughts), after that medication overuse, and finally physical activity.\nThrough all the treatment stages, the physical therapist used techniques to support the patient’s behavior change, with self-monitoring, feedback, shaping, pacing and fading. To strengthen the patient’s self-efficacy in ability to influence the headache and to succeed in the behavior change was important.\nAll outcomes were considered as proxy measures for increased control over muscular tension, psychological stress, and medication overuse.\nThe goal of headache a maximum of two days a week was not met.\nSince the variability of the outcome in diaries through the baseline and treatment phases proved to be high, it was decided that the patient would fill in the diary continuously through the follow-up period (A3) and not only at 1 week before the follow-up visits. The diary for weeks 39 and 40 was lost by the patient.\nHeadache frequency and headache index are presented in and . The variability is high and makes it difficult to draw conclusions, although the trend is that both headache frequency and index reduced slightly from baseline, through intervention, to follow-up.\nThe behavior of migraine medicine consumption reduced considerably when this was targeted in treatment and was stable on a lower level through follow-up, although the variability was high ().\nThe behavior of over-the-counter analgesics’ consumption varied through the phases with no certain difference from baseline through treatment to follow-up ().\nFor the disability and feelings of loss of happiness the variability was high and no trends could be observed ().\nHMSE increased considerably, from baseline to after treatment and through follow-up, indicating that her self-efficacy for managing headache did increase during the treatment ().","{

"Case 2: A 23 year old male, presented with symptoms of crawling sensation and foreign body sensation in his right eye, and had observed a worm in this eye. He had no previous symptoms prior to his presentation. He gave a history of having worked in a cocoa farm plantation during his childhood years and had severally suffered from bites from unknown flies. He had no systemic symptoms nor signs and aside from his ocular complains was healthy. There was no swelling anywhere in the body and no itching. Upon ocular examination his visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. The only significant finding was the presence of an actively mobile worm in the nasal subconjunctival space of the right eye """". This worm soon migrated upwards towards the superior fornix and away from view during the examination and before removal could be attempted """". The patient was immediately asked to adopt a face down position and within 30minutes of this time; he could feel a crawling sensation again in the same eye indicating that the worm was back. He was quickly taken to the operating room and the worm was extracted successfully using a local infiltration of the conjunctiva with lignocaine anesthesia. Histological examination revealed it to be an adult Loa loa worm.\nCases 3: A 25 year old female who had suffered sensation of movement and foreign body sensation in both eyes for the past 10 years and gave a past history of swimming in rural streams during childhood years. There was no history of swelling on the body and no itching. She had noticed an increasingly frequent occurrence of a worm like movement in both eyes over these years. Following ingestion of diethyl carbamazepine she noticed a sudden appearance of a red patch in the right eye. Upon examination her visual acuity was 6/5 in both eyes. The only significant finding was a localized hyperemic raised lesion on the surface of the right eye. This turned out to be a subconjuctival worm in the inferotemporal subconjunctival space of the right eye. The worm was found to be lifeless and covered by a surrounding cyst wall """". Care was taken to dissect the conjunctival and subtenons tissue away from the encysted worm, which was carefully extracted with a toothless forceps.

"An 11-year-old boy visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of persistent right cheek pain. His family history revealed that his father had severe hearing impairment. His medical history showed that he had allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis that had been treated until 3 months previously by an otolaryngologist.\nThe patient initially visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling 6 weeks previously. A checkup at a dental clinic performed on the day before this initial visit revealed no abnormal findings. He showed clinical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal infection showed positive results. The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal infection. Facial cellulitis was also suspected and treatment with amoxicillin helped improve symptoms. However, facial pain recurred within 4 weeks of the initial visit. The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN. Subsequently, oral clarithromycin administration was initiated for sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. However, administration of clarithromycin for 1 week was not effective for his facial pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no neurovascular compression ( right), which ruled out idiopathic, classical TN. During this time, we interviewed the patient on the nature of the right cheek pain. The patient described the pain as persistent, nagging, and dull in nature, which was completely different from the characteristics of pain associated with TN. Furthermore, trigger maneuvers failed to evoke pain. These evaluations excluded TN, and, thus, PIFP was diagnosed in week 2. Low dose of oral anticonvulsant carbamazepine (50 mg, twice a day) was initiated but was ceased due to general fatigue after the first administration.\nAlthough the patient had been previously cheerful and greeted us when entering the examination room, he became gradually emotionless with headache and nausea in week 5. In addition, feeding difficulties and numbness in the arms occurred. An orthostatic tolerance test revealed no positive findings for orthostatic dysregulation. It became difficult for the patient to attend school in week 6. Because various somatic symptoms developed in addition to PIFP, psychological factors were suspected to be pertinent in the etiology of PIFP. During a detailed medical interview with the patient and his mother, several problems were revealed: the patient loved swimming but his swimming record had plateaued after fixing his swimming form even though he practiced vigorously at a top-class swimming club team. Moreover, because of a recent finger injury, he could not practice as intensely as he wanted; therefore, his competitive ability as a swimmer deteriorated. Furthermore, in early adolescence, the patient had difficulties in communication and his relationship with his father was strained due to the father's hearing impairment. Because these suggested that the circumstances surrounding him might have led to somatoform disorders, psychological counseling was ordered in week 6.\nAs the patient faced, understood, and tolerated his psychological stress through counseling and psychotherapy twice a week, he gradually became expressive, worked up his appetite, and could attend school in week 10. Although sinusitis recurred at week 29, no facial pain developed. The patient received psychological counseling twice or thrice a month by this time. After 8 months, the frequency of counseling was reduced to once in 2 months. During this period, the patient's voice changed and became deeper at puberty. After confirming that facial pain as well as general malaise did not occur, even when the patient experienced distressing events, such as terminal examinations, counseling was ceased after 1 year and 8 months. After 3 years, the patient went on to high school and currently attends school cheerfully without any complaints and has resumed swimming.","{

After 3 years, the patient went on to high school and currently attends school cheerfully without any complaints and has resumed swimming.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of increased water intake and abnormal movements with loss of consciousness'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Serum sodium levels', 'Finding': 'Low serum sodium levels'}, {'Test': 'CT scan brain', 'Finding': 'No abnormalities'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Psychogenic polydipsia', 'Type': 'Psychological disorder', 'Location': 'N/A'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Behavior therapy and medication management', 'Details': 'Started on olanzapine and clonazepam for antianxiety effects.

"A 16-year-old male runner fell forward over an outstretched left leg during a race. He felt a popping sensation with his left hip in deep flexion and the left knee in forced extension and a sharp pain in the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh. He could not bear weight on the affected leg, which prevented him from walking and he was immediately transferred to our hospital. He had no history of other trauma, chronic disease, or use of corticosteroids. A clinical examination revealed swelling and tenderness at the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh. The ridge formed by the left biceps femoris tendon was distinctly deficient to both visual inspection and palpation. Active extension or flexion of the left knee was prevented by severe pain. Ligamentous instability of the knee was not evident and the left knee appeared normal on plain radiography images. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the left thigh revealed a loss of continuity of the distal biceps femoris tendon at the musculotendinous junction surrounded by a hematoma with high signal intensity (). Isolated rupture of the distal part of the left biceps femoris tendon was diagnosed and surgical exploration proceeded under lumbar spinal anaesthesia. A lateral incision over the belly of the biceps femoris revealed that the biceps femoris tendon had completely ruptured at the musculotendinous junction (). The tear was repaired using a modified Kessler method with strong nonabsorbable sutures.\nThe knee was postoperatively immobilized in a plaster cast at 30° of flexion. However, the patient described numbness and sensory loss over the anterior aspect of the left foot and dorsiflexion of the foot was weak on the day after surgery. Common peroneal nerve palsy at the fibular head due to compression by the plaster cast was diagnosed and the cast was removed to decompress the nerve. However, this did not result in any neurological improvement. Surgical assessment was applied 2 months after the common peroneal palsy occurred. Reexploration findings showed complete repair of the ruptured tendon, but the common peroneal and sural nerves were entrapped by the surgical suture, which had also penetrated the common peroneal nerve. Both nerves were obviously constricted after removal of the surgical suture (). Both nerves were externally neurolysed and scar tissue was removed. Motor function completely recovered 15 months later, but some residual numbness in the lower left leg persisted.","{

"A 36-year-old man, originally from Latin America, presented at our outpatient department with complaints of abdominal pain that had persisted for 2 months. The patient had first noticed right lateral abdominal pain 2 months prior to the visit, and the pain was gradually worsening. The abdominal pain was localized in an area ranging from the right upper to the right lateral abdomen. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital. He had returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at our clinic. When he went back to Japan, his weight had increased from 130 kg to 145 kg. He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin. Abdominal pain persisted despite treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate, and any cause of abdominal pain was not detected on further evaluations, including hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, or abdominal computed tomography (CT). Finally, he was referred to our hospital for further examination.\nThe results of screening for depression were negative, and the patient did not have symptoms such as loss of interest, depressed feelings, or any specific changes of surrounding conditions, such as family or work environment changes. He had no history of sexually transmitted infection, and his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination result was positive for Carnett’s test, and a prior surgical scar of approximately 18 cm was apparent at the right subcostal region. The patient experienced strong pain surrounding the surgical scar that was exacerbated by tapping. There were no skin rashes localized surrounding the pain. His pain exacerbated to 8 on a pain scale when he moved, such as during standing up or rolling over simultaneously. When he stopped moving, pain was partially relieved within 1 minute (3 on a pain scale). When he moved again, abdominal pain was again exacerbated. Hence, he was awakened by the abdominal pain when rolling over. No inflammation was detected (leukocyte count was 8580/mm3 and C-reactive protein was 0.10 mg/dl), and other laboratory findings were nonspecific, including liver/kidney function, blood glucose, and electrolytes. Urinary analysis indicated red blood cell count < 1/high-power field, white blood cell count 1–4/high-power field. Additionally, no abnormality was detected for Chlamydia trachomatis IgG/IgA, and no abnormality was apparent on the electrocardiogram. Enhanced CT revealed bilateral renal stones and fatty liver.\nWe first considered abdominal wall pain due to nerve entrapment because the Carnett’s test result was positive; therefore, we scheduled a trigger point injection at the site of tenderness. About 2 weeks later, the patient visited the emergency department of our hospital, reporting that his prior abdominal pain had decreased but that he was experiencing right inguinal pain. Loxoprofen administration had no effect on the pain. Costovertebral angle pain was apparent on tapping, the result of urine analysis was positive for occult blood, and abdominal CT revealed a urinary stone at the right urinary duct to the bladder. After pentazocine hydrochloride was administered for pain relief, the urinary stone was passed the following day. However, the patient’s right lateral abdominal pain was not relieved.\nHe felt that lying in the lateral position mostly relieved his pain. He had occasional vomiting. The abdominal pain was exacerbated by movements, such as rolling over, standing up, walking, and coughing. Injection of 1% xylocaine 10 ml at a trigger point of the right lateral region led to about 30% relief in pain. The patient was referred to an anesthesiologist for further evaluation and treatment, who performed transverse abdominal plane block and administered multiple analgesic medications (tramadol hydrochloride, pregabalin, celecoxib, and scopolamine butylbromide). These medications decreased the patient’s pain somewhat, and he reported that scopolamine butylbromide was most effective when the pain worsened. Because the patient’s symptoms were not relieved after trigger point treatment to the abdominal wall, we considered potential causes that might be associated with the location between the abdominal wall and visceral wall or related to other sources, including psychosocial, physiological, and other anatomical factors. We rechecked the abdominal CT scan for a suspected adhesion or abdominal hernia at the region of tenderness due to the prior surgical procedure, and we asked a radiologist to reevaluate the right upper abdomen in more detail. The radiologist confirmed a slight abnormality in the right upper abdomen and suggested the possibility of an adhesion around the surgical scar (Fig. ). We referred the patient to a gastrointestinal surgeon for laparoscopic evaluation and adhesiolysis. The patient underwent additional investigations, including cholecystocholangiography and colonoscopy for suspected postcholecystectomy syndrome, biliary dyskinesia, or colon abnormality. However, no cause of the abdominal pain was identified. On laparoscopic evaluation, a broad adhesion was observed. Adhesiolysis was performed 6 months after the patient first visited our hospital. Figure a shows adhesion between the peritoneum and omentum, liver, and ascending colon; Fig. b shows the condition after adhesiolysis. One month after adhesiolysis, the patient’s right abdomen pain level during movement improved from 8 to 2–3 on a pain scale. Therefore, he was able to move with less pain, and he did not feel pain when rolling over. The result of Carnett’s test was negative. After the patient started walking around his house, he felt abdominal pain about 5 minutes after walking. Hence, he was afraid of recurrence of abdominal pain and felt a little depressed and frustrated because he was unable to return to work early. We recommended a gradual increase in activity. He went on a trip 4 months after the operation without problems due to abdominal pain and then resumed his job 6 months after the operation.\nHowever, his abdominal pain deteriorated within 1 month after he resumed working. He presented with bleeding at the umbilicus, which was the laparoscopic port site, and abdominal incisional hernia was confirmed on the basis of CT. Repair of the abdominal incisional hernias and laparoscopic adhesiolysis were performed 8 months after the first operation. After the second operation, although it took time for some symptoms to improve because of surgical site infection, the patient’s symptoms were ultimately relieved, and he resumed his job again 5 months after undergoing the second operation. Although he reported mild abdominal pain and required analgesic medication, his weight decreased to 133 kg, and he was able to walk normally and work full-time, 2 years after he initially visited our hospital. The timeline of interventions and outcomes is shown in Additional file .","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Presented with masses on the left arm and axilla', 'Symptoms started several years prior, denied any significant health issues before that'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Biopsy of mucinous adenocarcinoma reported three years prior'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Mass in the left thoracic region and left humerus, visible'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Multiple masses in left humerus and axillary region, invading skin and surrounding structures'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Metastatic adenocarcinoma', 'Type': 'Secondary tumor', 'Location': 'Left arm, axilla, chest, breast'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Amputation', 'Details': 'Radical amputation of upper extremity and scapula with reconstruction'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Stabilized in post anesthesia care unit, discharged after two weeks', 'DischargeStatus': 'Wound healed, reduced pain levels reported'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Twelve weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Initially reduced pain levels, eventually became pain-free'}}}"
"An otherwise healthy 22-year-old caucasian woman consulted for an initial orthopedic examination due to an accelerated growth of a large mass over the posterior aspect of her right buttock and lower lumbar region. The mass had been present for over 5 years and had gradually enlarged during this time. Recently, the lesion had increased in size rather rapidly.\nAt another treatment facility, when the patient was 18 years of age, she underwent debulking of a tumor from the right buttock, which was complicated with a very profuse intraoperative hemorrhage resulting in a severe hypotension and acute kidney failure requiring 8 units of blood for stabilization. The patient was later discharged and did not continue followup at that treatment facility. In spite of this, the mass in the right buttock and lumbar region continued undergoing slow growth until it limited her daily activities. Upon arriving at our center, physical examination revealed a large, firm, amorphous, fluctuant, soft tissue mass measuring 60 × 50 × 30 cm. that originated from the lumbar region and extended to the gluteal fold and overhanging from the posterior aspect of her thigh ().\nMRI was technically difficult due to the dimensions of the tumor. The extension of the mass was unable to be determined with certainty because portions of it remained outside of the field of view. The mass exhibited intermediate signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images, and several fluid collections were identified (). The images demonstrated multiple serpiginous flow voids in keeping with prominent vasculature. The mass did not infiltrate the underlying gluteal musculature. Core needle biopsy was performed and the results were consistent with PNF; there was no evidence of malignancy in the tissue sample.\nThe case was reviewed at our multidisciplinary musculoskeletal tumor committee. The treatment consensus opted for preoperative embolization, as this would potentially reduce the perioperative blood loss considering the vascularity and size of the lesion. Surgical resection of the bulk of the lesion would then be undertaken and closure achieved with local tissue advancement or free flap transfer. It was not feasible to widely excise the lesion as it was infiltrating almost circumferentially around the patient.\nThe diagnostic angiogram confirmed the presence of multiple vessels supplying the tumor (). The feeding vessels identified were the right intercostal and lumbar arteries (), the right superior and inferior gluteal arteries, and the right circumflex iliac artery. Branches of the right profunda femoris and the left internal iliac arteries () were also visualized. A supraselective catheterization was done to perform a selective embolization using Gelfoam and PVA particles. Exceptionally, microcoils were also used. Due to the number and caliber of vessels to treat as well as the amount of contrast that will need to be used, the preoperative embolization was performed sequentially 5 days and 1 day before surgery.\nThe final angiogram showed almost complete devascularization of the tumor (). Tumor regression was satisfactory, with large areas of skin necrosis after embolization and with no associated systemic complications.\nTwenty-four hours after the second intravascular embolization, the patient was transferred to the operating room for surgical resection (). By positioning her prone on the operating table we were able to manipulate the lesion satisfactorily. An incision was made along the right posterior medial limb from the upper portion of the buttock to the thigh. Dissection through the superficial tissues necessitated some dissection through tumor tissue, which was highly vascular with large friable vessels. To reduce intraoperative bleeding, we decided to use the system Stapling Endo (Endo GIA) (). Once deep to the lesion, it was possible to encompass it and dissect it off the deep structures through a normal fatty plane, tying off the main feeding vessels that were demonstrated by angiography. The huge pedunculated gluteal mass was removed completely (). Local skin flaps were extensively mobilized and primary closure obtained (). Estimated blood loss for the procedure was 1000 mL, and the patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells. There were no intraoperative complications.\nThe specimen weighed 16,700 gr. and measured 60 × 45 × 27 cm (). Grossly there was diffuse presence of a myxoid-like white tan tissue, infiltrating into the surrounding fat. Histological examination revealed a plexiform neurofibroma with no evidence of malignancy (). Superficial margins were positive, consistent with the intralesional procedure.\nTwo weeks after the surgery, the patient had central areas of skin breakdown and cellulitis of the right lower extremity. The patient underwent revision of the closure secondary to infection of the surgical wound. Large cavities containing pus were identified. Cavities were curetted and pulse lavaged. Cultures grew Escherichia coli and the patient was started on IV cefepime, vancomycin, and gentamicin. Vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC; Kinetic Concepts Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) was placed with 150 mmHg continuous suction and the patient responded well. The surgical wound healed and the patient was discharged after a total of 5 weeks and was followedup in clinic with physical examination and serial local MRI every 3 months ().\nTwo years postoperatively, the patient walked without assistance. She was asymptomatic, and physical exam did not reveal any local recurrence. There was considerable improvement in her appearance and mobility. Local MRIs have not revealed recurrence or tumor progression ().","{

"Our patient is a 38-year-old male who presented with right chest wall and shoulder pain after a weight lifting injury. The patient was performing a one-rep max bench press when he felt a pop in his right upper arm, accompanied by severe pain. There was no history of anabolic steroid use. He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ). He was scheduled for surgery in five days. Two days later, the patient returned to our facility with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm. Intracompartmental pressure readings in the anterior compartment of the arm taken about the midpoint of the biceps at the point of maximal swelling were 37, 39, and 42 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure of 71 mmHg (). Thus, with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome confirmed, we proceeded to the operating room for an emergency fasciotomy with repair of the pectoralis major tendon rupture.\nAn extended deltopectoral approach was used, and the deltopectoral and biceps fascia were released. Immediately, a large amount of hematoma was expelled and the muscle bellies visibly bulged from the incision sites (Figures and ). All muscles still appeared viable. No apparent vascular damage was noted. Upon further dissection, both heads of the pectoralis major were found to be avulsed from the proximal humerus (). After preparation of the footprint with curette and rongeur, three double-loaded 4.5 mm Mitek suture anchors (DePuy Synthes, Raynham, MA) were placed lateral to the bicipital groove for the repair of the tendon. The proximal and distal suture anchors were used such that one suture of each was run in a Krakow fashion along the superior and inferior aspects of the tendon, respectively. The remaining suture from each of those anchors was passed in a horizontal mattress fashion medial to the Krakow stitches. The middle suture anchor was used to place a horizontal mattress stitch with a medial ripstop stitch (). The wound was irrigated, and a negative pressure dressing was applied. The patient was made nonweightbearing and placed in a sling with a circumferential strap to ensure adduction of the arm. The patient returned to the operating room four days later to undergo irrigation and debridement with a tension-free primary wound closure. He was again placed into his sling and given strict instructions to avoid abduction and external rotation of the arm. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home in a stable condition that same day with a one-week follow-up appointment. He continued to do well and was instructed to remain nonweightbearing in his sling for a total of 6 weeks before beginning formal therapy. Gentle stretching and passive range of motion were then begun, followed by strengthening exercises at the 12th week mark. At his four-month follow-up, the patient had active forward flexion of the shoulder to 150°, abduction to 150°, and external rotation of 50°. His rotator cuff, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors, and interossei all demonstrated 5/5 strength. There were no sensory deficits on examination. He continues to attend therapy for motion and strengthening and has a lifting restriction of <5 pounds at work.","{

"A 72-year old man, previously well, was admitted to a regional hospital with fever, recurrent bloody sputum, weight loss and left sided chest pain of 4 weeks duration. A chest radiograph showed a mass at the left hilum thought to be a neoplasm (see figure ). A misdiagnosis of haematemesis led to an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showing oesophagitis. He developed respiratory failure requiring ventilation. A subsequent bronchoscopy excluded a central bronchial tumour, confirmed by histopathologic examination of biopsies. He was transferred to a specialist centre where a CT and MRT scans of the thorax showed the mass to be infiltrating the left upper lobe and was suspicious for an aneurysm of a coronary artery (see figure ). Transthoracic echocardiography and MRI confirmed this impression and he proceeded to coronary angiography, which demonstrated a giant aneurysm from the LAD (figure ). He developed cardiovascular instability and proceeded emergently to surgery.\nThe procedure was performed using right atrial to aortic cardiopulmonary bypass via median sternotomy and opening of the anterior pericardium. The aneurysm was adherent to the left anterolateral pericardial aspect and was not disturbed until cardioplegic arrest was achieved, to avoid distal embolization in a beating heart. After achieving myocardial arrest the dissection was completed, revealing the aneurysm to have entry and exit openings into the proximal and mid LAD (see figure ), and there was compression of the left upper lobe with airway inflammation rather than invasion. The adherent pericardium was removed together with the aneurysm and a large quantity of thrombus, leaving a significant pericardial defect requiring Supple-Guard patch closure. The proximal and distal communications from the LAD to aneurysm were closed. A single end-to-side vein graft was performed in the mid LAD distal to the aneurysm (see figure ). After reperfusion and rewarming cardiopulmonary bypass was weaned without difficulty. Thereafter the medial surface of the left upper lobe was inspected, confirming absence of a fistula.\nThe patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where after a period of inotropic support, he was stabilised and extubated on the 2nd post-operative day but developed respiratory insufficiency requiring 5 further days of ventilation. He was discharged well on the 27th post-operative day and had no further events at follow up to 7 months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Recurrent painless swelling in the left thigh'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgery': ['Excision of left mid-thigh swelling in 2005', 'Excision of left distal thigh swelling in 2009']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographs of the thigh', 'Finding': 'Suggestive of fibrous dysplasia'}, {'Test': 'MRI of whole thigh', 'Finding': 'Two additional soft tissue masses in left mid-thigh and left inguinal region'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': ""Mazabraud's syndrome"", 'Type': 'Rare disorder', 'Location': 'Left thigh'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Wide excision of distal thigh swelling', 'Details': 'Intramuscular mass within vastus medialis, excised'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No recurrence', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient remained asymptomatic with decrease in size of one lesion and minimal increase in size of another'}}}"
"The patient was a 17-year-old male who was in previously good health with no history of hearing loss or significant medical issues. He was found at home and was unresponsive due to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. He was sleeping on the family couch in the living room on the first floor. Due to a hurricane-related power failure, a diesel generator was running in the family's connected garage. The patient was later found unconscious on the couch. Other family members were also found unconscious on the scene; not all of the family members survived the CO poisoning. The patient had been unconscious for an unknown period of time and was taken to a shock trauma center by emergency personnel arriving at the scene. He was intubated due to his level of consciousness.\nUpon arrival at the shock trauma center, a CT scan of the head showed no signs of obvious pathology. A chest X-ray showed evidence of a small focal consolidation on the lower right lobe. There was evidence of mild bilateral calcification suggesting pulmonary edema. On the evening of his admission, he was taken to a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. The day after his admission an MRI was administered which showed some evidence of anoxic brain injury. He was found to have diffuse white matter cytotoxic edema which involved the bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. He was later extubated while at the shock trauma center. By the time of his discharge from the shock trauma center he was able to follow some simple commands and was able to pass a PO diet. However, he remained nonverbal. He was discharged when believed to be stable after nine days to an inpatient brain injury rehabilitation facility. Prior to his transfer his auditory status was not formally assessed.\nUpon admission to the rehabilitation facility he was arousable for short periods of time and was able to respond to yes-no questions with a head nod. Initially he was uncooperative with physical examination. He would attempt to verbalize and was able to follow one-step commands. Overall he had generalized weakness and was flaccid on the left with an increase in tone on the right. His sensation was intact on all four extremities as were deep tendon reflexes. He was diagnosed at admission with gait dysfunction, dysphasia, and generalized weakness. He received intensive physical, occupational, and speech language pathology therapies during his admission where he remained for 23 days. Initially, he appeared to be aphasic. Over the course of his admission his alertness level normalized, and he became more oriented. His speech and language skills reemerged, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet. He was discharged to home after 16 days with 24-hour supervision required. His hearing was never formally assessed during the admission.\nHe subsequently received 13 days of intensive physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy at a day program three days a week. He also received an in-depth neuropsychological evaluation prior to returning to school as well as grief counseling. He was diagnosed at this time with mild mixed aphasia and mild-moderate cognitive deficits. While receiving speech and language pathology services at the day rehabilitation facility, the patient complained of difficulty in hearing to the speech and language pathologist and was referred for an audiological evaluation.\nThe patient was seen for an audiological evaluation 54 days after his exposure to CO. He denied tinnitus. The obtained audiogram is shown in . Findings indicated the presence of a bilateral hearing loss of sensorineural origin. For the right ear, findings indicated the presence of normal sensitivity from 250 to 1000 Hz, sloping to a moderate hearing loss at 1500 Hz and a moderate-to-severe hearing loss at 2000 Hz and above. For the left ear, findings indicated the presence of normal sensitivity at 250–1000 Hz, sloping to a mild hearing loss at 1500–2000 Hz and a moderate-to-severe hearing loss at 3000 Hz and above. Bone conduction thresholds interweaved with air conduction thresholds indicating the impairment to be sensorineural in origin bilaterally. Speech reception thresholds were in good agreement with frequency-specific findings bilaterally. Word recognition performance in quiet was fair-poor bilaterally at a level 40 dB above the speech reception threshold but improved to fair-good at 80 dB SL. There was no PB rollover for either ear. Word recognition performance was not disproportionately impaired relative to the degree of pure-tone sensitivity loss []. Tympanometry revealed normal tympanic membrane/middle ear system mobility bilaterally. Acoustic reflexes were absent or present at elevated sensation levels for ipsilateral stimulation of both ears. Measurements of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were undertaken for stimulation of both ears. TEOAEs were absent for both ears from 1000 to 4000 Hz, indicating the presence of outer hair cell dysfunction bilaterally. Subsequent audiological assessment one month later revealed no significant changes in the patient's pure tone sensitivity as shown in . Hearing aids were recommended, and the patient was provided with an FM system during the duration of his rehabilitation activities at the day program rehabilitation facility. Staff interacting with the patient in his therapies noted some immediate improvement in his performance. He was subsequently issued binaural hearing aids which were to be coupled with an FM system in his school setting.","{

"Case 2: A 23 year old male, presented with symptoms of crawling sensation and foreign body sensation in his right eye, and had observed a worm in this eye. He had no previous symptoms prior to his presentation. He gave a history of having worked in a cocoa farm plantation during his childhood years and had severally suffered from bites from unknown flies. He had no systemic symptoms nor signs and aside from his ocular complains was healthy. There was no swelling anywhere in the body and no itching. Upon ocular examination his visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. The only significant finding was the presence of an actively mobile worm in the nasal subconjunctival space of the right eye """". This worm soon migrated upwards towards the superior fornix and away from view during the examination and before removal could be attempted """". The patient was immediately asked to adopt a face down position and within 30minutes of this time; he could feel a crawling sensation again in the same eye indicating that the worm was back. He was quickly taken to the operating room and the worm was extracted successfully using a local infiltration of the conjunctiva with lignocaine anesthesia. Histological examination revealed it to be an adult Loa loa worm.\nCases 3: A 25 year old female who had suffered sensation of movement and foreign body sensation in both eyes for the past 10 years and gave a past history of swimming in rural streams during childhood years. There was no history of swelling on the body and no itching. She had noticed an increasingly frequent occurrence of a worm like movement in both eyes over these years. Following ingestion of diethyl carbamazepine she noticed a sudden appearance of a red patch in the right eye. Upon examination her visual acuity was 6/5 in both eyes. The only significant finding was a localized hyperemic raised lesion on the surface of the right eye. This turned out to be a subconjuctival worm in the inferotemporal subconjunctival space of the right eye. The worm was found to be lifeless and covered by a surrounding cyst wall """". Care was taken to dissect the conjunctival and subtenons tissue away from the encysted worm, which was carefully extracted with a toothless forceps. Conjunctival incision site was closed with interrupted sutures. Histology revealed an adult Loa loa worm.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chronic abdominal pain', 'Weight loss of 10 kg in the past six months'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant previous health issues'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Transvaginal ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Cystic formation sized 83 × 65 × 64 mm in the right adnexal area'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal CT scan', 'Finding': 'Cyst sized 100 × 80 mm with signs of peripheral calcification in the right ovary'}, {'Test': 'Colonoscopy', 'Finding': 'Benign polyp of the sigmoid colon and submucosal round smooth cystic formation at the site of the appendix'}, {'Test': 'Tumor markers', 'Finding': 'CEA: 54.2 ng/mL (elevated)'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Appendix'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Laparotomy with appendectomy, omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingooophorectomy', 'Details': 'Meticulous dissection, frozen section, and six cycles of chemotherapy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '12 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Remains in good health'}}}"
"A 41-year-old white woman with a past medical history of endometriosis presented to our clinic for her annual examination. She wanted to discuss cyclic rectal bleeding after having undergone a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy and left oophorectomy 1 year prior. She stated that, over the past 6–8 months, she had been experiencing bloody bowel movements for 1 week each month, in the same pattern as her previous menstrual cycles. She also experienced sharp, lower abdominal pain with these bloody bowel movements, similar to the pain from her endometriosis in the past. She described a mild to moderate amount of bleeding and noted that the blood was typically mixed with stool. The blood was dark red, which she believed looked very similar to her menses. She reported normal bowel movements the other 3 weeks of the month. Prior to her hysterectomy, she completed a colonoscopy which showed no transmural implants. Previous treatment for endometriosis included oral contraceptives which gave no significant symptomatic relief. Her other past medical history included hypertension for which she was taking extended-release metoprolol 50 mg in the morning and 25 mg in the evening before bed. She had never smoked tobacco and consumed alcohol occasionally. At that time, she worked as a systems engineer for information technology.\nShe had the onset of menarche at age 10 with heavy periods until age 16, at which time she went on oral contraceptive pills. At age 37, she gave birth to twins at 29 weeks of gestation via cesarean section without complications. Her other surgical history included a tonsillectomy at age 3, cervical conization at age 22, rhinoplasty at age 26, exploratory laparoscopy for excision of stage IV endometriosis with en bloc excision, left ovarian cystectomy, and bilateral ovarian suspension at age 34, as well as total hysterectomy, as mentioned above.\nShe denied any family history of endometriosis, although she noted that her mother had heavy periods prior to giving birth to our patient. Her mother also suffered from asthma. Her father had heart disease and her grandparents had a history of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol, hypertension, osteoporosis, and alcohol abuse.\nOur patient’s examination revealed a temperature of 36.7 ºC, heart rate of 57 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 129/78 mmHg. She was alert and oriented with no focal neurologic deficits. Cardiac and lung examinations were normal. An abdominal examination revealed normoactive bowel sounds with no tenderness to palpation. No external hemorrhoids were visualized on rectal examination and stool guaiac was negative. An anoscopy was not performed.\nOur differential diagnoses when we first saw her were: invasive endometriosis, internal hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, adenocarcinoma of the colon, inflammatory bowel disease, and angiodysplasia.\nLaboratory tests revealed a largely normal complete blood count (CBC) with a hemoglobin of 12.4, platelet count was 196,000, and white blood cell count was 10,000. Our patient’s electrolytes and kidney function were normal with creatinine of 0.9, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 13, and albumin of 4.1. Other examinations such as urine analysis, serology, and microbiology were not drawn. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her pelvis, with and without contrast, was performed. Findings were consistent with invasive endometriosis in the pelvis, with possible sigmoid colon invasion (Figs. and ). A colonoscopy was performed and revealed a stricture in the recto-sigmoid colon and endometrial implants (Figs. and ). This was thought likely to be extrinsic infiltrating endometriosis affecting the submucosal and mucosal layers with erythematous mucosal changes. These sites were biopsied. The final pathology report revealed fragments of colonic mucosa with marked lamina propria and submucosal congestion (Figs. and ). Immunostaining for estrogen receptor was negative.\nOur patient was referred for follow-up with both Gynecology and Colorectal Surgery. She was advised by the surgical team to undergo exploratory laparotomy with removal of any endometrial implants and resection of the affected colon to avoid worsening stricture and potential obstruction. They recommended sparing of the remaining ovary to avoid surgical castration which, in women under the age of 45, has been shown to correlate with increased all-cause mortality [, ].\nShe opted to not proceed with the surgery due to concern of recurrence by maintaining her right ovary; she decided to manage the bleeding with stool softeners, increasing the dosage during her menstrual periods. After deciding for the non-surgical approach, our patient never complained about the same symptoms again, suggesting that the stool softeners managed her symptoms. Since her diagnosis over 4 years ago, her pain and bleeding have improved and she is starting to feel the first symptoms of menopause including hot flashes, mood swings, and difficulty sleeping. Since her menopausal symptoms have been mild and intermittent, she has decided to hold off from seeking treatment for them at this time.","{

"A 36-year-old man, originally from Latin America, presented at our outpatient department with complaints of abdominal pain that had persisted for 2 months. The patient had first noticed right lateral abdominal pain 2 months prior to the visit, and the pain was gradually worsening. The abdominal pain was localized in an area ranging from the right upper to the right lateral abdomen. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital. He had returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at our clinic. When he went back to Japan, his weight had increased from 130 kg to 145 kg. He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin. Abdominal pain persisted despite treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate, and any cause of abdominal pain was not detected on further evaluations, including hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, or abdominal computed tomography (CT). Finally, he was referred to our hospital for further examination.\nThe results of screening for depression were negative, and the patient did not have symptoms such as loss of interest, depressed feelings, or any specific changes of surrounding conditions, such as family or work environment changes. He had no history of sexually transmitted infection, and his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination result was positive for Carnett’s test, and a prior surgical scar of approximately 18 cm was apparent at the right subcostal region. The patient experienced strong pain surrounding the surgical scar that was exacerbated by tapping. There were no skin rashes localized surrounding the pain. His pain exacerbated to 8 on a pain scale when he moved, such as during standing up or rolling over simultaneously. When he stopped moving, pain was partially relieved within 1 minute (3 on a pain scale). When he moved again, abdominal pain was again exacerbated. Hence, he was awakened by the abdominal pain when rolling over. No inflammation was detected (leukocyte count was 8580/mm3 and C-reactive protein was 0.10 mg/dl), and other laboratory findings were nonspecific, including liver/kidney function, blood glucose, and electrolytes. Urinary analysis indicated red blood cell count < 1/high-power field, white blood cell count 1–4/high-power field. Additionally, no abnormality was detected for Chlamydia trachomatis IgG/IgA, and no abnormality was apparent on the electrocardiogram. Enhanced CT revealed bilateral renal stones and fatty liver.\nWe first considered abdominal wall pain due to nerve entrapment because the Carnett’s test result was positive; therefore, we scheduled a trigger point injection at the site of tenderness. About 2 weeks later, the patient visited the emergency department of our hospital, reporting that his prior abdominal pain had decreased but that he was experiencing right inguinal pain. Loxoprofen administration had no effect on the pain. Costovertebral angle pain was apparent on tapping, the result of urine analysis was positive for occult blood, and abdominal CT revealed a urinary stone at the right urinary duct to the bladder. After pentazocine hydrochloride was administered for pain relief, the urinary stone was passed the following day. However, the patient’s right lateral abdominal pain was not relieved.\nHe felt that lying in the lateral position mostly relieved his pain. He had occasional vomiting. The abdominal pain was exacerbated by movements, such as rolling over, standing up, walking, and coughing. Injection of 1% xylocaine 10 ml at a trigger point of the right lateral region led to about 30% relief in pain. The patient was referred to an anesthesiologist for further evaluation and treatment, who performed transverse abdominal plane block and administered multiple analgesic medications (tramadol hydrochloride, pregabalin, celecoxib, and scopolamine butylbromide). These medications decreased the patient’s pain somewhat, and he reported that scopolamine butylbromide was most effective when the pain worsened. Because the patient’s symptoms were not relieved after trigger point treatment to the abdominal wall, we considered potential causes that might be associated with the location between the abdominal wall and visceral wall or related to other sources, including psychosocial, physiological, and other anatomical factors. We rechecked the abdominal CT scan for a suspected adhesion or abdominal hernia at the region of tenderness due to the prior surgical procedure, and we asked a radiologist to reevaluate the right upper abdomen in more detail. The radiologist confirmed a slight abnormality in the right upper abdomen and suggested the possibility of an adhesion around the surgical scar (Fig. ). We referred the patient to a gastrointestinal surgeon for laparoscopic evaluation and adhesiolysis. The patient underwent additional investigations, including cholecystocholangiography and colonoscopy for suspected postcholecystectomy syndrome, biliary dyskinesia, or colon abnormality. However, no cause of the abdominal pain was identified. On laparoscopic evaluation, a broad adhesion was observed. Adhesiolysis was performed 6 months after the patient first visited our hospital. Figure a shows adhesion between the peritoneum and omentum, liver, and ascending colon; Fig. b shows the condition after adhesiolysis. One month after adhesiolysis, the patient’s right abdomen pain level during movement improved from 8 to 2–3 on a pain scale. Therefore, he was able to move with less pain, and he did not feel pain when rolling over. The result of Carnett’s test was negative. After the patient started walking around his house, he felt abdominal pain about 5 minutes after walking. Hence, he was afraid of recurrence of abdominal pain and felt a little depressed and frustrated because he was unable to return to work early. We recommended a gradual increase in activity. He went on a trip 4 months after the operation without problems due to abdominal pain and then resumed his job 6 months after the operation.\nHowever, his abdominal pain deteriorated within 1 month after he resumed working. He presented with bleeding at the umbilicus, which was the laparoscopic port site, and abdominal incisional hernia was confirmed on the basis of CT. Repair of the abdominal incisional hernias and laparoscopic adhesiolysis were performed 8 months after the first operation. After the second operation, although it took time for some symptoms to improve because of surgical site infection, the patient’s symptoms were ultimately relieved, and he resumed his job again 5 months after undergoing the second operation. Although he reported mild abdominal pain and required analgesic medication, his weight decreased to 133 kg, and he was able to walk normally and work full-time, 2 years after he initially visited our hospital. The timeline of interventions and outcomes is shown in Additional file .","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Poor esthetic appearance due to missing upper and lower front teeth since 4 years', 'Seeking prosthetic treatment'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Intraoral examination', 'Finding': 'Generalized grade II and grade III mobility, poor oral hygiene, plaque and calculus deposits'}, {'Test': 'Panoramic radiograph', 'Finding': 'Short, malformed roots, taurodontism, periapical radiolucencies'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Dentin dysplasia type I', 'Type': 'Developmental dental disorder', 'Location': 'Maxillary and mandibular teeth'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Extraction of mobile teeth, rehabilitation with prosthesis', 'Details': 'Extraction of right maxillary first molar, histopathologic examination'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient receiving prosthesis for missing teeth'}}}"
"A 27-year-old right-hand-dominant and otherwise healthy female student presented with a pain in the right upper scapular region that increased with shoulder motion and resting in the supine position. She reported that a painless snap in her back had occurred during sports activity 11 years previously and had disappeared 2 years later after discontinuing sports activity. The pain in the right upper scapular region had appeared 3 months earlier during continuous inputting to her personal computer and had rapidly worsened. She presented at a nearby hospital because the pain was generated during activities of daily life and prevented her from sleeping in the supine position. A physician suspected a malignant bone tumor based on radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and referred the patient to our hospital.\nThe patient had no relevant family or medical history. The right shoulder was slightly lower than the contralateral shoulder. There were no neurological deficits in the right shoulder or arm. There was winging of the right scapula with the arm at the side. An upper interval between the spine and the medial scapular border was widened by 70%, but the lower one was not (). There was no atrophy of the back muscle, and contraction of the trapezius was normal. The muscle bellies of the short rotators and rotator cuff were not tender and were without defects. The limitations of the active ranges of motion were 10° for total elevation, 15° for external rotation, and two vertebrae for internal rotation. Horizontal adduction was not limited with moderate pain beyond 100°. The empty can test generated upper scapular pain. No deformity or osseous tumor was palpable in the large joints, pelvis, or ribcage. Radiographs revealed a bone mass extruding from the ventral side of the superomedial scapular angle; no abnormality was depicted in the large joints. Computed tomography showed a mushroom-shaped osseous tumor composed of a cortex continuous with the scapular cortex, with a broad flat distal end that almost contacted with the third rib, as well as a soft tissue tumor between the serratus anterior and the ribcage (Figures and ). MRI taken at the previous hospital revealed a cystic lesion containing a large amount of fluid that surrounded the osseous tumor and spread over the upper two-thirds of the scapula (Figures and ). Marked rim enhancement was demonstrated on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imagery with fat suppression. From these imaging findings, our diagnosis was a solitary OC with a large bursa; the possibility of malignant transformation was considered to be low.\nWe performed surgery 3 months after the patient's first visit to our hospital. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position with the shoulder flexed and abducted at 110°. The upper extremity was supported on a pillow to avoid excessive horizontal adduction so that the superomedial scapular angle was situated just underneath the middle trapezius. A 10 cm longitudinal incision was made along and 3 cm medial to the medial scapular border, centering at the most proximal end of the scapular spine. The trapezius and rhomboid minor were divided along their fibers. The thick and edematous cyst wall exposed in the bottom of the operative field was cut, and about 100 ml of clear yellow-brown fluid flowed out. The stalk of the OC arose in the superomedial scapular angle 1 cm lateral to the medial scapular border and penetrated the subscapularis and serratus anterior muscles. The base of the lesion was cut with its periosteum along the ventral scapular surface. We cut the attached thick fibrous tissue attached around the distal stalk, which was considered to be a bursal wall. After resection of the osseous lesion, a large cystic space appeared, covered by a white thick membrane considered to be inflamed synovial tissue; at the bottom of this space a 1 × 3 cm section of the rib surface was exposed in the defect of the thick membrane (). There was no free body in the space or palpable indurations on its wall. We irrigated the space, sutured the fascias of the divided muscles, and subsequently closed the skin.\nMacroscopically, the typical thick perichondrium and cartilage cap were not found, although the flat distal end of the lesion was covered by spotty fibrocartilage-like tissue (). Histological examination revealed characteristic findings of OC without any malignant changes. The distal end was covered by synovial tissue and was composed of bony trabeculae in which mostly fatty tissue and bone marrow intervened.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. The patient returned to normal daily life and full activity 3 weeks postoperatively. At the time of final follow-up 12 years postoperatively, the right scapula was in the normal position, the scapulothoracic rhythm was symmetrical, and there was no limitation of active range of motion or any associated crepitus. The Constant score ratio compared with the contralateral left shoulder was 100% []. MRI showed no abnormality of the soft tissue or bony structures ().","{

"A 52-year-old female patient visited the Outpatient Department of Our Dental College and Hospital with a chief complaint of a nonhealing ulcerated tissue on the left lower back tooth region for the past 6 months, associated with pain and burning sensation during intake of spicy or hot food items occasionally. She developed continuous severe burning sensation accompanied by pain since 1 week in the same region. No relevant past medical, dental, occupational, and habit history was observed in relation with the chief complaint.\nOn soft tissue examination, a solitary, firm, ulcerative tissue measuring 2 × 2 centimetres was found on the alveolar mucosa near premolar region separated from it by clinically healthy mucosa. On stretching the cheek mucosa, a tooth root was found extruding from the socket impinging on the soft tissue counterpart surrounding areas (Figures and ). No other lesions were observed on either side of the oral mucosa. After comprehensive intraoral examination followed by analysis of the past dental and relevant history, an interim diagnosis of traumatic ulcer was given in association with the tooth as the source of origin. Patient consent was obtained before proceeding with the treatment. Extraction of the tooth root was performed under local anaesthesia (). The procedure was uneventful, and postoperative instructions were given for the same. The patient was normal and freed of complaints during postoperative follow-up made after 15days.\nThe patient reported again to the outpatient department with similar complaints of pain and severe burning sensation after 3 months in the same region. On intraoral examination, nodular proliferous ulcerative growth measuring 3 × 2 centimetres was found on the alveolar mucosa near the premolar-molar region with focal areas of white spots (). She was referred immediately to our oral pathology department followed by prescription of topical application of antiviral drugs (2% acyclovir) for a week. As the lesion did not show signs of regression, routine blood investigations were carried out to rule out complications following biopsy and were found to be normal. An incisional biopsy was advised for the same with differential diagnosis of focal epithelial hyperplasia; traumatic fibroma, verruciform leukoplakia, verruca vulgaris, verrucous carcinoma, and ulcerative squamous cell carcinoma were suggested.\nHistopathological analysis showed a broad bulbous rete pegs with pushing margins in many areas along with features of mild dysplasia and few areas of parakeratin plugging. There were also few areas of severe dysplasia without significant break in the basement membrane and malignant cells infiltrating into the subjacent minimal connective tissue stroma with inflammatory cells which led to a provisional diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma of buccal mucosa.\nVerrucous carcinoma has particular clinical and histopathological features that agree its diagnosis to be obtained, which was an uncharacteristic observation in the present case. First, the clinical reasons for rejection were considered followed by the histological ones for each diagnosis, to obtain a final diagnosis thus clearly separating from others. Oral traumatic fibroma was ruled out since it presents as a firm smooth papule in the mouth, usually the same colour as the rest of the mouth lining, but is sometimes paler or, if it has bled, may look a dark colour. The surface may be ulcerated due to trauma or become rough and scaly. It is usually dome-shaped but may be on a short stalk like a polyp or pedunculated []. It should be noted no histological dysplastic features and other observations are not present and fibromas never develop into oral cancer, similarly verrucous hyperplasia (VH) are often associated with papillomas or arise as a de novo lesion. VH (verrucous hyperplasia) and PVL (Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia) are irreversible clinicopathologic lesions with considerable potential for evolving into verrucous or squamous cell carcinoma. PVL is a disease of the oral cavity in which VH is a part of its developmental spectrum. Human papillomavirus, as a cofactor, may play an important role in some of these lesions [, ]; however, no signs suggestive of HPV infection were observed in the present histopathology section.\nIn the present case, as no other findings like nodal involvement or metastasis were observed, clinical staging of T2N0M0 was given. A wide local surgical excision was planned and performed under local anaesthesia (). To ensure complete removal of the lesion with clear margins, further examination of the complete surgical specimen was sent for histopathological investigation and also to rule out infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma. The procedure was uneventful, and postoperative instructions were given. A postoperative follow-up was performed at an interval of every 15 days over a period of 3 months. No further complaints were observed.\nIn this instance, though varied clinical course of the disease was noted, the histological result of the complete surgical specimen showed features of verrucous carcinoma similar to the reports obtained during the incisional biopsy thus ruling out squamous cell carcinoma evolved from a verrucous carcinoma (). Thus, on complete evaluation of clinical and histological findings, a conclusive diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma (VC) was given.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Referred to Nephrology Department with newly diagnosed SLE', 'Spontaneous miscarriage during second trimester of pregnancy', 'Significant proteinuria and microscopic hematuria', 'Reach ESKD after 4 years of immunosuppression'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Diagnosis': 'Class III lupus nephritis with crescents', 'Treatments': ['Initial regimen of cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and azathioprine', 'Later modified to mycophenolic acid with rituximab'], 'RenalReplacementTherapy': 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'AdditionalMedications': ['Hydroxychloroquine', 'Low dose methylprednisolone'], 'Complications': ['Recurrent fevers with inconclusive etiology', 'High CMV viral load requiring IV immunoglobulin', 'Periodic upper respiratory infections and tonsillitis', 'Acquired immunodeficiency requiring monthly IVIG']}, 'TransplantHistory': {'Type': 'Cadaveric kidney transplant', 'CompatibilityAnalysis': {'SharedHLA': 2, 'DonorCMVStatus': 'Positive'}, 'ImmunosuppressionRegimen': ['Basiliximab', 'Mycophenolic acid', 'Tacrolimus', 'Methylprednisolone', 'Prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir'], 'PostoperativeComplications': ['Lymphocele requiring surgical management']}, 'PostTransplantProgress': {'ContinuedTreatment': 'Monthly IVIG', 'ImmunoglobulinProfileChange': 'Detection of IgG CMV antibodies and HBV surface antibodies', 'Immunophenotyping': 'Almost absent CD20+ lymphocytes count'}}}"
"A 29-year-old male was transported to the emergency department after a traumatic near total amputation of the right distal tibia due to a motorcycle accident; the patient's leg was run over by a truck. The distal portion of the leg was severely crushed and the only remaining portions were the anterior and posterior tibial nerves, the tibialis anterior tendon, and some soft tissue connections, with no viable blood flow to the distal stump (). The amputation site was critically contaminated, with circumferential degloving tissue loss of approximately 15 cm in length at the distal portion of the lower leg ().\nA comminuted fracture of the tibia and fibula was observed at the distal portions with damage to the ankle joint. Despite the severity of the damage to the amputated region, the general condition of the patient remained fairly stable. The total ischemia time was more than 10 hours of warm ischemia.\nAfter an external fixator was applied to the open tibial fracture and internal fixation was performed for the fibula, wound exploration was performed (). Thrombosis of the anterior tibial artery and a 20-cm-long segment of the artery's crushed intimal structure were observed, along with a similarly damaged vein. The posterior tibial vessels showed an arterial gap of 10 cm, with one accompanying vein ruptured and the other vein crushed with a venous gap of 7 cm (). The posterior tibial vessels appeared more promising for a successful repair. A lesser saphenous vein graft was harvested from the contralateral leg in a 12 cm segment for the arterial reconstruction (). After blood flow resumed, 400 mL of blood was drained before the vein was repaired.\nThe ruptured vein was repaired primarily, and the vein with a 7 cm gap was repaired with an 8 cm strip of arterial graft from a non-thrombosed segment at the middle portion of the thrombosed anterior tibial artery ().\nThe healthy vein graft was considered more reliable for the arterial reconstruction than the arterial graft from the damaged anterior tibial artery. Therefore, the posterior tibial arterial reconstruction was achieved using the 12 cm harvested contralateral lesser saphenous vein graft. The skin and soft tissue defect around the proximal stump underwent minimal debridement and the Vacuum-Assisted Closure System (KCI Medical, San Antonio, TX, USA) was applied for demarcating the necrotizing portions. To protect the anastomosis site, vessel graft site coverage was performed using overlying soft tissue remnants and a bovine dermal substitute (Matriderm, Dr. Suwelak Skin and Health Care, Billerbeck, Germany), while avoiding applied direct negative suction pressure. During the operation, 800 mL of whole blood was transfused. Prostaglandin E1 (Eglandin, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Korea, Seoul, Korea) and heparin were administered for 2 weeks postoperatively. After the replantation, there were no immediate complications such as pulmonary thromboembolism or shock. Two weeks after the replantation, the wound was demarcated and clean. No definite sign of infection was observed.\nInternal fixation of the tibial bone was carried out and coverage of the defect with a 25×15 cm sized latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap was performed (). The thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed to the middle 1/3 anterior tibial vessels, where undamaged structures in an end-to-end fashion were found. Split-thickness skin grafts were performed simultaneously to cover portions without exposing major structures. The flap healed well, but long-standing use of a splint resulted in a pressure sore at the heel region with exposure of the Achilles tendon.\nWe performed coverage with bovine dermal substitute (Matriderm, Dr. Suwelak Skin and Health Care, Germany) and split-thickness skin graft to the area 3 weeks after the second surgery.\nThe patient was discharged soon afterwards, and was walking with crutches (). Six months after the operation , the patient was ambulatory without aid, and no additional procedures were required (). Twelve months after the operation, sensory recovery of the foot sole was quantitatively measured using two-point discrimination sensation by a esthesiometer. The two-point discrimination sensation on the damaged foot sole was measured at 14 mm and that of the patient's healthy foot sole was measured at 13 mm. The sensation of the damaged foot sole was not significantly different from that of the healthy foot sole. A grade II in the Chen criteria of the replanted lower limb was achieved. The patient and his family were satisfied with the results.","{

"A nineteen-year-old female patient who had severe facial trauma was referred for dental rehabilitation after a series of esthetic surgery operations. The patient's history revealed a blow to her face after falling off a cliff during mountain biking. Her initial evaluation in Emergency Service reported that her general condition was poor, and her hemoglobin value was 6 mg/dL with severe maxillofacial trauma and bleeding. The patient had an emergency consultation at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery after a rapid hemodynamic stabilization and CT scans. According to the medical records obtained from her physician, she had a severe soft tissue injury and accompanying comminuted bone fractures on bilateral maxilla, zygoma, periorbital area, mandible, and nasal bones. Bone fragments were fixed with titanium plates and screws without bone grafting. There was also a posterior vertical split fracture on the hard palate extending anteriorly to both sides creating a mobile free bone fragment on the anterior maxilla. Those fractures were also fixed after reconstruction and then soft tissue repair was done. Complications were not seen in the early postoperative period; however, followup of the patient indicated bone necrosis on the anterior maxilla including the alveolar process extending to the palate. After debridement of the necrosis process, the defect was reconstructed with mucosal flaps and bony reconstruction was postponed. The patient refused the bone graft surgery planned for the repair of the defect on the anterior maxilla and had been consulted for prosthetic treatment.\nHer clinical examination showed soft tissue defects on the face particularly eye area and dysmorphic appearance (). The panoramic radiograph demonstrated mini plates and screws used for fixing fractured zygomatic arch, orbital, and maxillary sinus walls. Intraoral examination revealed the absence of the anterior maxillary alveolar ridge and bone until the apex line; both maxillary central and lateral incisors and right canine teeth were lost as a result of traumatic injury ().\nThe patient had an Angle Class I occlusion with an acceptable vertical and horizontal overlap prior to the accident. Because of the loss of premaxillary segment, the patient experienced speech problems and had difficulty in biting and swallowing (). In addition, the maxillary lip had lost support and was depressed into the defect area. The mandible was overclosed, resulting in a decrease of the vertical facial height. The temporomandibular joints were asymptomatic and jaw movement was in normal limits. The patient has complained of her inability to communicate, emotional disturbance of her appearance, and anxiety about the restoration of her teeth. After her extensive surgical procedures, initially temporary acrylic prosthetic rehabilitation was applied approximately one year later after trauma in order to restore her oral and dental function ().\nAs a treatment method, the zirconia-based crown bridge prosthesis had been planned and applied between right first molar teeth through left second premolar teeth for the replacement of the missing teeth (). A new centric relation was made to transfer the articulator and shade was selected. This prosthesis was combined with gingiva-colored porcelain (Noritake Super Porcelain; Noritake, Nagoya, Japan) to compensate for the loss of hard and soft tissue on the anterior maxillary area and lip support. The zirconia framework was veneered by feldspathic porcelain and occlusion balance was checked. Definitive zirconia_crown bridge prosthesis was fabricated using computer aided design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system (Procera, Nobel Biocare). The patient was given home oral health care instructions, including use of dental floss, interproximal brushes, and an oral mouth rinse.\nThe advantages of combined prosthesis included esthetic and biocompatible restoration with zirconia prosthesis. A satisfactory esthetic and functional result was achieved after fixed denture adjustments (). After the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th months recall visit, the patient was satisfied with her new appearance and had no functional difficulties during eating, chewing, or swallowing. Speech impairment was eliminated considerably and the patient's profile was improved to a certain degree. In a followup of 5 years period, the prosthesis was stable and there was no evidence for relapse or dysmorphology was found.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Vesicular eruptions on the left side of the face since 5 days', 'Burning sensation in the affected area'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant past medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': []}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Herpes Zoster', 'Type': 'Viral infection', 'Location': 'Ophthalmic and maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Antiviral therapy and pain management', 'Details': 'Acyclovir 800 mg orally 5 times daily for 7 days, tramadol 50 mg twice daily'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good improvement in lesions', 'DischargeStatus': 'Pain reduction and lesion remission'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1 year', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Pain free after 10 weeks of treatment'}}}"
"This was a 23-year-old man with a history of blunt trauma to his right hand. While working, an electric motor rolled on his right hand and forearm, resulting in swelling and abrasions on the dorsum of his hand and elbow. There were no fractures seen on radiographs. No surgery or sutures were needed. He complained of constant pain for 15 months. He was diagnosed with RSD without objective imaging conformation. He received a cervical epidural block 3 months after the injury, a stellate ganglion block 4 months after the injury, and an intravenous block 5 months after the injury. He stated that none of these treatments helped his pain. Seven months after the injury, a dorsal column stimulator was implanted, which he stated relieved 50% of the pain. The patient presented 15 months after the injury for a medical evaluation as part of workers’ compensation litigation process. He claimed constant pain and the inability to use his right hand and arm. Upon physical examination, the patient held his right hand in a clenched fist posture with his fingers overlapping. He held his elbow and wrist in a fixed flexed posture and adducted against his body, as shown in .\nHe would only abduct his arm minimally at the shoulder. It was noted that the patient was suntanned, including the axillary area on the right side and on his right chest. All finger nails appeared to be chewed short on both hands. He stated that he did not bite his nails on his right hand because he could not get his hand to his mouth. He claimed that he picked the nails of his right hand off with his left hand. He later stated that his right hand was too tender to be touched, yet there was no allodynia on examination. There was no obvious atrophy upon examination of the upper extremities. Mineralization of the bones was symmetrical on bilateral radiographs. The patient initially claimed that his right hand had been in this position for 6 months, while his wife later said he had held his hand in this position for 1 year. His wife stated that his hand did open while sleeping.\nA private investigator was hired by the patient's former employer. The video surveillance showed the patient grasping and casting repeatedly with a fishing rod and reel in the hand that he claimed to be nonfunctional with a full range of motion.","{

"A 23-year-old male patient presented with cubitus varus deformity of the left elbow. The patient developed the deformity following some fracture around elbow in the childhood at the age of 8 years that was managed conservatively in plaster cast after closed reduction. On examination, the boy had 15° of cubitus varus deformity, full range of elbow movements, and no distal neural deficit.\nRadiograph showed an oblique joint line suggestive of varus deformity and evidence of old healed remodeled fracture line. Two foramina of 3-4 mm diameter were seen on anteroposterior view on a vertical plane. The distal hole had a sharp margins while proximal had indistinct margins, similar holes were seen in oblique view [].\nThis child was undertaken for lateral wedge corrective osteotomy at elbow, The lateral approach to the elbow between the flexor and extensor compartments was used to expose the site of osteotomy. When the perisoteum from the anterior surface of the lower humerus was lifted, some anomalous structure entering into the bone was noticed on the medial side of the supracondylar region. On further dissection it looked like neural tissue [], and was thought to be the median nerve. We attempted to make a window into the bone and free the nerve but it was seen that the nerve was severely entrapped in the bone and on our repeated attempts to remove it, it got transected. We planned to explore all the three nerves at the elbow to ascertain the identity of the nerve as its course was very aberrant. We explored both the median and the ulnar nerves and found them intact. We could not find the radial nerve in its normal course. Thus we got ascertained that the involved nerve was the radial nerve. We did the osteotomy as planned and closed the wound. The nerve was not repaired as it was found to be nonrepairable. Post operatively the function of both ulnar and median nerves was normal, but there was radial nerve palsy [Figure and ].\nThe elbow was mobilized after 1 month. At 2 months all implants were removed and tendon transfers for radial nerve palsy, namely, pronator teres to extensor carpi radialis brevis, palmaris longus to extensor pollicis longus, and flexor carpi radialis to extensor digitorum communis was done. With extensive physiotherapy, the patient regained all his functions at about 4 months postoperatively.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for 1 month', 'History of emergency exploratory laparotomy 6 months back for peptic perforation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Abdominal surgery with burst abdomen post-operatively'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm x 7 cm'}, {'Test': 'Upper GI endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Small benign ulcer at the pylorus of the stomach'}, {'Test': 'CT fistulogram', 'Finding': 'Enterocutaneous fistula between pylorus of the stomach and abdominal wall'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Complex gastrocutaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Gastrointestinal fistula', 'Location': 'Pylorus of the stomach to abdominal wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Repeat exploratory laparotomy', 'Details': 'Dense adhesiolysis, drainage of abscess cavity, omental patch repair, feeding jejunostomy, retrograde tube duodenostomy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '4 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient had incisional hernia but overall doing fine'}}}"

"A 9 year-old girl has been referred to our clinic because of popping in her right hip for 9 months. Her mother stated that the popping sound was so frequent and loud that was disturbing to the sleep of the family during the night for the last couple of months. Her mother had a normal pregnancy with vaginal delivery without any problem. According to the records, postnatal physical examination by pediatrician in hospital was normal. She was the first child of the family. There was no record of any congenital or connective tissue disease in the family. Past medical history of the patient was negative for trauma. Educational and school records were in normal range. According to the family history she did not have any problem until 9 months ago. The popping was started after separation of her parents. The patient was used to live with her mother afterward. Although the patient was able to produce popping voluntarily during the day but the chief complaint was the frequent and loud popping sound at night after falling asleep. The popping was painless. In physical examination there was no ligamentous laxity and the hip joints were painless, normal in range of motion and stable in all directions. We asked the patient to produce the popping. She positioned the right hip up to 90 degrees flexion and 15-20 degrees adduction, after doing a slight internal rotation we heard a sudden loud popping sound and hip was displaced in posterior direction. After dislocation she relocated the hip by external rotation and abduction. The maneuver was painless. Routine lab tests were normal. Pelvic and right hip radiographs were normal (, ). An anteroposterior radiograph after dislocation maneuver revealed hip dislocation with wide space between the femoral head and the acetabulum (). We discussed the problem and its nature with parents and referred the family to the psychological consultation. The family took part in sessions of family therapy.

"A 92-year-old man was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery on a two-week wait basis for assessment of an ulcer on the tongue (). History revealed that the ulcer had been present for two months, was painful and causing discomfort while swallowing. The patient had lost seven kilograms of weight in one month, and he attributed this to the inability to eat due to pain. He had no significant relevant medical history. Social history revealed that he had been a pipe smoker for many years and took moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis.\nClinical examination of the head and neck region revealed a 3 cm diameter indurated ulcer of the left posterior dorsum of the tongue. This ulcer was highly suspicious of malignancy. Examination of the neck revealed an ipsilateral solitary lymph node of 4 cm diameter in level 3 region. The patient was informed of the possible diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent urgent incisional biopsy under local anaesthesia, and the histopathology report was suggestive of an adenocarcinoma (). Additional immunohistochemistry performed on the specimen demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma expressed cytokeratin 20 but lacked cytokeratin 7. In addition, the large bowel marker CDX2 was positive, whereas the pulmonary marker TTF1, the thyroid marker, thyroglobulin, and the prostate marker, PSA, were all negative. This suggested that the presenting oral lesion was the first sign of a possible distant metastasis of a primary bowel carcinoma.\nThe patient underwent further investigations; chest X-ray, MRI head and neck, and CT chest and abdomen. The CT demonstrated a sigmoid carcinoma with local lymphadenopathy and also evidence of distant metastasis to right axillary, hepatic, intrapulmonary, retroperitoneal, brain, and bony disease to the thoracic vertebra. This patient was discussed in the head and neck multidisciplinary team meeting and subsequently referred to colorectal team for treatment. The colorectal team confirmed the presence of rectosigmoid tumour on colonoscopy that proved histologically to be a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred for palliation due to the extensive nature of his disease.","{

"A 21-year-old female, a Saudi student, presented to the Otolaryngology Department as an outpatient complaining of a left upper maxillary alveolar progressive recurrent mass of six months. The mass had started as a small swelling over the left maxillary alveolar ridge where excision had been done accordingly in the dental office. One month later, the mass had reappeared with rapid growth and had never regressed until a facial bulge was visible. On further history, the patient did not mention any problems with swallowing or respiration, and her past medical history was insignificant with no chronic illness and no prior history of exposure to radiation or chemotherapy and no history of benign bone conditions. Regarding her family history, there was no genetic predisposition or other malignancies. Furthermore, surgical and dental history was insignificant with no pharmacological medications and no history of allergies or smoking.\nOn physical examination, an irregular mass on the left anterior maxillary alveolar ridge measuring around 2 x 2 cm (Figure ) with a missed upper lateral incisor was noted. The overlying mucosa was intact and there was no ulceration. There was no pus coming out of the mass and examination of the cervical lymph nodes revealed no abnormalities. Upon radiological workup, there was no evidence of distant metastasis or any signs of other abnormality.\nThe recurrence of the mass warranted further investigation as an initial differential of osteomyelitis or other mixed lesions. After obtaining the patient’s written consent, an incisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia where the histopathology showed high-grade (G3), chondroblastic osteosarcoma (Figure ).\nWhen we discussed the surgical options and treatment with the patient, she was reluctant to follow the treatment protocol and chose to seek a second opinion. After a few months, she presented with a slight increase in mass size (3 x 2 cm).\nA CT scan of the neck done on the same day showed a maxillary lesion with small growth (3 mm). The lesion was seen in the alveolar process of the left maxilla and appeared to be mostly lytic with no material or sunburst changes, while the lesion itself was seen between the left incisor and the left canine; meanwhile, the left lateral incisor was not seen (Figure ). Also, there was no extension into the anterior nasal septum or incisive canal, no superior extension to the submucosa of the left nasal cavity, and no invasion into the palate. The lesion was separate from the orbicularis aureus muscle with no infiltration of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. In addition, a diffuse bilateral mildly enlarged lymph node was noted at level 2A with a few subcentimetric occipital lymph nodes. The adenoid was enlarged, causing mild narrowing of the airway with no obstruction whatsoever. Further investigation was requested, and an MRI of the neck showed left maxillary alveolar ridge osteolytic soft tissue mass of around 3.3 x 1.8 cm extending superiorly to the inferior nasal apparatus (Figure ). Meanwhile, CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were ordered to exclude any other malignancies, and they showed no evidence of metastasis or lesions.\nRegarding the treatment regimen, the case was discussed in the tumor board and four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were given, which consisted of doxorubicin and cisplatin. The response to the chemotherapy was very good and the tumor size shrank substantially (Figure ). The chemotherapy was followed by left inferior maxillectomy with a 1.5-cm safety margin with tracheostomy and a left-sided supra-omohyoid neck dissection. Intraoperatively, the frozen section was taken post excision, which showed negative safety margins. With regard to reconstruction, it was carried by an obturator prosthesis, which was planned due to the unavailability of the plastic surgeon. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for a few days for close observation of respiration and, one week later, she was discharged home in stable condition and was advised to follow up with the Oncology Centre for adjuvant chemotherapy.\nThe final histopathology showed a tumor that measured 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm with extensive therapy-related effect (>99% necrosis) (Figure ) and negative margins. There was no lymphovascular invasion and all the resected lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. The final pathological staging post-surgery was T0N0M0. The patient received two further cycles of doxorubicin and cisplatin postoperatively, and she is still following up with the Oncology Center with no signs or symptoms of recurrence for three years.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Crush and degloving injury to the right elbow', 'Massive skin and soft tissue defects on the anterior aspect of the elbow'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Initial Examination', 'Finding': 'Exposure of median nerve and brachial artery, muscle weakness, and 6-cm gap in radial nerve'}, {'Test': 'Second Examination', 'Finding': 'Bacterial infection detected, saphenous vein bypass graft performed'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Crush and degloving injury to the right elbow', 'Type': 'Trauma', 'Location': 'Elbow'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical reconstruction', 'Details': 'Debridement, saphenous vein bypass graft, muscle flap placement'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Infection resolved, muscle strength improved, protective sensation confirmed'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1.5 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved grasp and hand function'}}}"
"A 29-year-old, G2P2 mother was diagnosed with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome more than five years ago and has had two pregnancies while being treated with sirolimus. These children were small for gestational age at birth and are the focus of this case report. Upon diagnosis of this rare disorder, the patient was treated with oral sirolimus 2mg twice daily. Her cutaneous lesions resolved significantly at 6 months follow up. She had a flare up of the lesions when she discontinued treatment before preconception. Her family history is unremarkable. She conceived naturally at one year of sirolimus therapy through a non-consanguineous marriage. Both the partners are of average built and denied tobacco, alcohol or substance use. In view of the previous flare up history following preconception planning, she was advised to continue sirolimus by the treating physician. Prenatal care for the first pregnancy included an ultrasound for determination of gestational age and routine monitoring of possible side effects of sirolimus. Regular blood investigation revealed normal complete blood count, liver and renal functions, sugar and lipid profile. Routine antenatal checkup done at the rural health care center by the Health Assistant were uneventful. Records maintained in the prenatal care book showed normal blood pressure, maternal weight gain, height of fundus corresponding to gestational age and normal hemoglobin level. Fetal ultrasound done at 36 weeks of gestation at the district hospital by a sonographer technician revealed a single live fetus with adequate amniotic fluid and expected fetal weight corresponding to 34 weeks. In view of maternal medical condition, sirolimus therapy and suspected fetal growth restriction, the mother was referred to the tertiary hospital. No gross anomalies were noted on limited anomaly examination and umbilical artery doppler study was within the normal range for the gestational age. At 40 weeks, she delivered a normal live male newborn weighing 2200 grams (<10th percentile on the customized fetal growth chart) with Apgar score of 9 and 10 at 1 and 10 minutes respectively. The baby had poor suckling and presumed physiological jaundice which were managed with intravenous fluid and phototherapy. Neonatal bilirubin and hemoglobin levels were not recorded. At two years of life, the milestones recorded in the child health card were appropriate for the age. The second pregnancy was likewise conceived naturally while the mother was on sirolimus therapy. Early in this pregnancy she was informed of the risks of miscarriage, poor growth and birth defects. Antenatal check up at the rural health center was unremarkable. Although, referred to the maternal fetal medicine specialist at the national referral hospital, the couple could not make it due to Covid movement restrictions. A live, normal male newborn weighing 2400 grams (<10th percentile on the customized fetal growth chart) was delivered at 39 weeks with Apgar score of 9 and 10 respectively at 1 and 10 minutes respectively. The postnatal period was uneventful. The mother was advised to continue sirolimus following the delivery.","{

"The patient is a pleasant 77 year old female who presented to the Neurology clinic to evaluate unexplained events of syncope. Incidentally, she reported cognitive difficulty over the one to two year period prior to first clinic visit; family history was positive for a sister with progressive dementia. Also, she reported an episodic right visual field event, with the first episode occurring 6 months prior that was relatively sudden when there was an alteration in vision that persisted raising concern for possible retinal ischemic event. Formal report by Radiology did not remark on the hemi-atrophy shown below in the occipital cortex and had no acute ischemic changes evident.\nShe had been followed closely by Ophthalmology, and was found to have right sided homonymous hemianopsia on exam which was confirmed by visual field test and had brain MRI which did not show any clear lesion other than small multiple nonspecific white matter lesions but also showed an asymmetrically larger posterior horn of left lateral ventricle with more prominent atrophy of left occipital lobe. She was not aware of her visual symptoms but later did admit that she cannot see well on her right side at times; this still did not compromise her daily activities and did not feel there was a significant visual field deficit. Her husband also confirmed that she had not had demonstrated any clear symptoms of right visual field deficit that was obvious to him. However, concern developed about her cognitive impairment on bedside cognitive function tests as well as clear right visual field symptoms with corresponding left occipital area atrophy, prompting further testing including a nuclear medicine brain SPECT prefusion scan as well as brain PET using the Florbetapir amyloid tracer (performed under informed signed consent as part of a research protocol approved by institutional IRB for the IDEAS trial).\nHumphrey field plots are shown in Figure 1; hemiatrophy of the visual cortex is shown by CT and MRI in Figure 2; reveals the functional defect for the left occipital cortex; shows no differences in the localization of the florbetapir tracer.\nDespite a major significant finding on exam, the patient still personally feels there is nothing obvious to her about a major defect in her vision. Clinical diagnosis remains as Alzheimer’s disease and has been given Donepezil and Memantine; additional new diagnosis established as Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of right lower quadrant pain and newly discovered mass at trocar site'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgery': 'Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy in December 2010'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': '10 mm right lower quadrant hernia with herniated fat and possible omental vessel'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Trocar site hernia', 'Type': 'Incisional hernia', 'Location': 'Right lower quadrant'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Laparoscopic incisional hernia repair with appendectomy', 'Details': 'Primary closure of hernia using 0-Ethibond sutures'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No complications at 2-week follow-up', 'DischargeStatus': 'Patient discharged home'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '12 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No evidence of hernia recurrence'}}}"
"A 41-year-old man had been diagnosed as having a middle esophageal diverticulum based on an upper gastrointestinal contrast examination performed when he was 30 years old. He had not received treatment because he was asymptomatic. Eight months earlier, he experienced chest discomfort after eating and visited our hospital. His past history is pediatric asthma. The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position and four trocars inserted into the right thoracic cavity. A 12-mm trocar was inserted into the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. Only the left lung was ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest was created using CO2 gas at 6 mm. Twelve-mm trocars were inserted into the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle. A 5-mm trocar was then inserted into the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the ninth intercostal space at the level of the inferior scapular angle. The operator used the 12-mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the inferior scapular angle line and the 5 mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The assistant used the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The endoscope was inserted into the lumen of the upper thoracic esophagus before the patient was placed in the prone position and kept in the esophagus throughout the surgery. Confirmation of the middle esophageal diverticulum was easily achieved, but the area was difficult to exfoliate because the diverticular wall had adhered to the lymph nodes of the trachea bifurcation. To achieve a complete resection of the diverticulum, threads were placed on the oral and anal sides of the diverticulum, the threads were pulled. A thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line and the surgical stapler was inserted via the 12-mm port placed in the ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle, and the diverticulum was resected using two sets of the Tri-Stapler (Fig. ). A postoperative upper gastrointestinal contrast examination revealed no abnormalities (Fig. ). Oral intake was initiated on postoperative day 7, and he was discharged on postoperative day 12. The histopathological findings were a true diverticulum with a muscular layer and a highly inflamed mucosa. No malignant findings were seen (Fig. ). Postoperatively, the patient visited the hospital at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the surgery. He underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal contrast examination 1 year after the surgery. We found no evidence of recurrence of the esophageal diverticulum. We are planning to repeat the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 2 years after the surgery.","{

"A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency room of another hospital with muscle weakness of the limbs after a cow struck his neck and chest. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine performed at that time revealed a dislocation of the 6th and 7th cervical vertebrae. An anterior internal fixation was conducted from the 6th cervical vertebra to the 1st thoracic vertebra on the day of the injury and a conservative treatment that involved maintaining a supine position was recommended. The patient was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation treatment 99 days after the injury. The neurological level of injury was determined to be C5 according to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment scale B. At that time, the patient was using an NG tube. A videofluoroscopic swallowing (VFS) test was attempted at 1 week after admission, but the test could not be performed because the patient could not remain in the required position. Hence, the test was performed 128 days after injury, after confirming that the patient could maintain the required position for the procedure. The oropharyngeal examination during the VFS test showed that the swallowing reflex and processes had progressed without any abnormal findings; therefore, the NG tube was removed and the oral feeding of a dysphagia diet was initiated.\nThe patient complained of swallowing during the feeding because of food stuck in the throat ; moreover, he experienced intermittent vomiting after the feeding. The ability to swallow at that time was estimated to be of grade 2 on the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) []. A laryngoscopy performed 3 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms revealed no abnormal findings like as laryngeal swelling. First, the patient underwent a surgery to treat a concomitant complaint of sore coccyx. Subsequently, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed 27 days after the initiation of oral feeding. This EGD indicated a stricture at 35 cm below the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and was unable to reach beyond this point (). The patient had no history of dysphagia prior to his injury, received no medications inducing endoscopy or stenosis before or after the injury and had no history of medical irradiation. Therefore, his stricture was suspected to be related to the NG tube. The patient was kept in a sitting position of 45° and antiulcer medication was added. The following day, a computed tomography of the chest was performed to examine a transverse section of the esophageal stricture. No mediastinal mass was observed, but a diffuse submucosal edema was present at the left, upper lobar bronchus level of the esophagus and the lumen was narrowed. A balloon dilatation was performed to extend the stricture. EGD-guided insertions of balloon catheters were performed; twice at 1 kPa for 1 minute and twice at 2 kPa for 1 minute, thus achieving a dilation of approximately 7 mm. The resulting esophagogram revealed an increase of the stricture lumen diameter by 3 mm. The patient's symptoms improved, but recurred after 1 day; therefore, a follow-up esophagography was performed. The procedure revealed that the diameter of the stricture had increased after the procedure, but the stenosis still remained. Therefore, an esophageal resection and a reconstruction with the left colon were recommended. However, the patient and his family consented to the surgery, especially and particularly because it would be considered as high risk due to his history of flail chest. A high risk of postoperative complications was also expected. Thus, the balloon dilatation was performed for a total of 4 times at our hospital. After the last balloon dilatation procedure, the patient's symptoms improved to grade 4 on the FOIS scale and an extension of 5 mm was observed for the lumen of the esophageal stricture by esophagography (). After discharge from our hospital, the patient regularly received balloon dilatation at another hospital for a total of 5 times. Each of the dilations was done for one minute for two times, similarly to the procedure in our hospital. Currently, his esophageal stricture is extended to 11 mm in diameter and the swallowing symptoms he experiences during meals have improved to grade 6 on the FOIS scale ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Initial presentation with typical angina', 'Subsequent presentation with multiple episodes of angina on exertion', 'Development of severe resting chest pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': True}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'ECG', 'Finding': '2 mm T inversion in V1-V3 leads, biphasic T waves in I, aVL and QT prolongation (QTc: 0.520 seconds)'}, {'Test': 'Coronary angiography', 'Finding': 'Two vessel disease, patent RCA and LAD stents, significant thrombotic narrowing of distal left main artery with extension of thrombus to proximal parts of both LAD and left circumflex arteries'}, {'Test': 'Echocardiography', 'Finding': 'Left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% without resting wall motion abnormalities'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Coronary artery disease', 'Type': 'Atherosclerotic heart disease', 'Location': 'Coronary arteries'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Coronary artery bypass grafting', 'Details': 'Two saphenous vein grafts on LAD and main obtuse marginal branches'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'No further complications, discharged after 3 days'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Not specified', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Not specified'}}}"

"Case 2: A 23 year old male, presented with symptoms of crawling sensation and foreign body sensation in his right eye, and had observed a worm in this eye. He had no previous symptoms prior to his presentation. He gave a history of having worked in a cocoa farm plantation during his childhood years and had severally suffered from bites from unknown flies. He had no systemic symptoms nor signs and aside from his ocular complains was healthy. There was no swelling anywhere in the body and no itching. Upon ocular examination his visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. The only significant finding was the presence of an actively mobile worm in the nasal subconjunctival space of the right eye """". This worm soon migrated upwards towards the superior fornix and away from view during the examination and before removal could be attempted """". The patient was immediately asked to adopt a face down position and within 30minutes of this time; he could feel a crawling sensation again in the same eye indicating that the worm was back. He was quickly taken to the operating room and the worm was extracted successfully using a local infiltration of the conjunctiva with lignocaine anesthesia. Histological examination revealed it to be an adult Loa loa worm.\nCases 3: A 25 year old female who had suffered sensation of movement and foreign body sensation in both eyes for the past 10 years and gave a past history of swimming in rural streams during childhood years. There was no history of swelling on the body and no itching. She had noticed an increasingly frequent occurrence of a worm like movement in both eyes over these years. Following ingestion of diethyl carbamazepine she noticed a sudden appearance of a red patch in the right eye. Upon examination her visual acuity was 6/5 in both eyes. The only significant finding was a localized hyperemic raised lesion on the surface of the right eye. This turned out to be a subconjuctival worm in the inferotemporal subconjunctival space of the right eye. The worm was found to be lifeless and covered by a surrounding cyst wall """".

"A 36-year-old man, originally from Latin America, presented at our outpatient department with complaints of abdominal pain that had persisted for 2 months. The patient had first noticed right lateral abdominal pain 2 months prior to the visit, and the pain was gradually worsening. The abdominal pain was localized in an area ranging from the right upper to the right lateral abdomen. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital. He had returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at our clinic. When he went back to Japan, his weight had increased from 130 kg to 145 kg. He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin. Abdominal pain persisted despite treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate, and any cause of abdominal pain was not detected on further evaluations, including hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, or abdominal computed tomography (CT). Finally, he was referred to our hospital for further examination.\nThe results of screening for depression were negative, and the patient did not have symptoms such as loss of interest, depressed feelings, or any specific changes of surrounding conditions, such as family or work environment changes. He had no history of sexually transmitted infection, and his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination result was positive for Carnett’s test, and a prior surgical scar of approximately 18 cm was apparent at the right subcostal region. The patient experienced strong pain surrounding the surgical scar that was exacerbated by tapping. There were no skin rashes localized surrounding the pain. His pain exacerbated to 8 on a pain scale when he moved, such as during standing up or rolling over simultaneously. When he stopped moving, pain was partially relieved within 1 minute (3 on a pain scale). When he moved again, abdominal pain was again exacerbated. Hence, he was awakened by the abdominal pain when rolling over. No inflammation was detected (leukocyte count was 8580/mm3 and C-reactive protein was 0.10 mg/dl), and other laboratory findings were nonspecific, including liver/kidney function, blood glucose, and electrolytes. Urinary analysis indicated red blood cell count < 1/high-power field, white blood cell count 1–4/high-power field. Additionally, no abnormality was detected for Chlamydia trachomatis IgG/IgA, and no abnormality was apparent on the electrocardiogram. Enhanced CT revealed bilateral renal stones and fatty liver.\nWe first considered abdominal wall pain due to nerve entrapment because the Carnett’s test result was positive; therefore, we scheduled a trigger point injection at the site of tenderness. About 2 weeks later, the patient visited the emergency department of our hospital, reporting that his prior abdominal pain had decreased but that he was experiencing right inguinal pain. Loxoprofen administration had no effect on the pain. Costovertebral angle pain was apparent on tapping, the result of urine analysis was positive for occult blood, and abdominal CT revealed a urinary stone at the right urinary duct to the bladder. After pentazocine hydrochloride was administered for pain relief, the urinary stone was passed the following day. However, the patient’s right lateral abdominal pain was not relieved.\nHe felt that lying in the lateral position mostly relieved his pain. He had occasional vomiting. The abdominal pain was exacerbated by movements, such as rolling over, standing up, walking, and coughing. Injection of 1% xylocaine 10 ml at a trigger point of the right lateral region led to about 30% relief in pain. The patient was referred to an anesthesiologist for further evaluation and treatment, who performed transverse abdominal plane block and administered multiple analgesic medications (tramadol hydrochloride, pregabalin, celecoxib, and scopolamine butylbromide). These medications decreased the patient’s pain somewhat, and he reported that scopolamine butylbromide was most effective when the pain worsened. Because the patient’s symptoms were not relieved after trigger point treatment to the abdominal wall, we considered potential causes that might be associated with the location between the abdominal wall and visceral wall or related to other sources, including psychosocial, physiological, and other anatomical factors. We rechecked the abdominal CT scan for a suspected adhesion or abdominal hernia at the region of tenderness due to the prior surgical procedure, and we asked a radiologist to reevaluate the right upper abdomen in more detail. The radiologist confirmed a slight abnormality in the right upper abdomen and suggested the possibility of an adhesion around the surgical scar (Fig. ). We referred the patient to a gastrointestinal surgeon for laparoscopic evaluation and adhesiolysis. The patient underwent additional investigations, including cholecystocholangiography and colonoscopy for suspected postcholecystectomy syndrome, biliary dyskinesia, or colon abnormality. However, no cause of the abdominal pain was identified. On laparoscopic evaluation, a broad adhesion was observed. Adhesiolysis was performed 6 months after the patient first visited our hospital. Figure a shows adhesion between the peritoneum and omentum, liver, and ascending colon; Fig. b shows the condition after adhesiolysis. One month after adhesiolysis, the patient’s right abdomen pain level during movement improved from 8 to 2–3 on a pain scale. Therefore, he was able to move with less pain, and he did not feel pain when rolling over. The result of Carnett’s test was negative. After the patient started walking around his house, he felt abdominal pain about 5 minutes after walking. Hence, he was afraid of recurrence of abdominal pain and felt a little depressed and frustrated because he was unable to return to work early. We recommended a gradual increase in activity. He went on a trip 4 months after the operation without problems due to abdominal pain and then resumed his job 6 months after the operation.\nHowever, his abdominal pain deteriorated within 1 month after he resumed working. He presented with bleeding at the umbilicus, which was the laparoscopic port site, and abdominal incisional hernia was confirmed on the basis of CT. Repair of the abdominal incisional hernias and laparoscopic adhesiolysis were performed 8 months after the first operation. After the second operation, although it took time for some symptoms to improve because of surgical site infection, the patient’s symptoms were ultimately relieved, and he resumed his job again 5 months after undergoing the second operation. Although he reported mild abdominal pain and required analgesic medication, his weight decreased to 133 kg, and he was able to walk normally and work full-time, 2 years after he initially visited our hospital.

"A 54-year-old right hand dominant Caucasian male cabinet maker was referred for evaluation and treatment of a left distal biceps tendon rupture that occurred 22 months before initial orthopedic evaluation. The patient reported that a heavy door to be installed at his job site fell toward him. He reached out with his left arm and tried to catch the door. As he did so, he felt an immediate sharp pain and tearing sensation in his left elbow. Over the next week, he noted the development of significant swelling and ecchymosis in the left forearm and elbow. He reported that injury to his employer, but was not referred for medical attention. He continued working despite the swelling and pain, relying mostly on his dominant arm to perform his job duties. Over the next several months, the patient noted increasing weakness of elbow flexion and supination and increasing deformity of his left biceps relative to the right side. On presentation, he reported he was unable to lift objects weighing more than 1—pounds and he was not able to flex or supinate his forearm without pain and weakness. He also reported muscle spasm in the left bicep muscle and significant atrophy of the left biceps muscle compared to the right. His main complaint was a profound weakness, specifically with supination, and to a lesser degree with elbow flexion, to the point where he was forced to rely on his right arm for both work-related activities and activities of daily living. He denied any prior history of elbow pain or weakness before his injury. Physical examination of the left upper extremity revealed an obvious deformity of the biceps with significant proximal retraction and atrophy of the muscle belly relative to the opposite side (). Maximum biceps circumference was 32.5 cm in the right arm compared to 29.5 cm in the left arm in the resting position. Palpation revealed tenderness over the biceps muscle belly, as well as over the antecubital fossa. There was also tenderness to palpation over the proximal radius and the radial tuberosity. The biceps tendon was not palpable at the musculotendinous junction or in the antecubital fossa. Range of motion (ROM) of the elbow was symmetric from 0 to 135° of flexion bilaterally. The patient reported pain with active but not passive ROM of the left elbow. He did not report pain with active pronation or supination of the forearm. Pronation and supination were90°, respectively, and were symmetric bilaterally. Strength testing revealed 3/5 strength with left elbow flexion and 3/5 strength with left elbow supination. Spasm of the biceps brachii was noted with attempted elbow flexion and supination against resistance. Sensory testing to light touch and pinprick revealed decreased sensation in the medial aspect of the forearm extending from the elbow to the distal 1/3 of the medial aspect of the forearm. Sensation on the lateral side of the forearm was intact. Anteroposterior, oblique, and lateral radiographs of the left elbow were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the left arm showed a chronic left distal biceps tendon rupture with 17 cm of retraction of the biceps tendon proximally. The retracted stump of the tendon was visualized at the junction of the middle and distal one-third of the humerus, surrounded by edema. There was also some evidence of lateral epicondylitis as well as an interstitial tear of the common extensor origin of the forearm involving 50% of the tendon thickness. An MRI of the elbow had not been obtained. Pre-operative assessment of elbow function utilizing Mayo Elbow Performance Index(MEPI) and disability of arm, shoulder, and hand questionnaire (DASH) [, ] was measured and compared with post-operative values used to evaluate clinical outcome. In the context of the patient’s symptoms, and in conjunction with the clinical and radiographic findings, surgical reconstruction utilizing Achilles tendon allograft augmentation through a two-incision anterior approach was recommended.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chronic regurgitation of ingested food', 'Multiple bouts of watery diarrhea'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None', 'PastMedicalProblems': ['Asthma', 'Anxiety']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Biliary sludge'}, {'Test': 'HIDA Scan', 'Finding': 'Ejection fraction of < 20%'}, {'Test': 'Upper Endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Normal'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Rumination syndrome', 'Type': 'Functional gastrointestinal disorder', 'Location': 'Upper gastrointestinal tract'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Medical management', 'Details': 'Loperamide, dicycloamine, nortriptyline, scopolamine'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Resolved by more than 85% in 6-month follow-up', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved quality of life and BMI'}}}"
"The case we present here is about a 40-year-old man who was referred to our pain clinic with severe ischemic pain of right lower limb. The pain started gradually 10 months back and became very severe for the last 1 month. The intensity of pain was increasing in both the sitting and lying down positions and decreasing in a standing position. Many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were tried earlier without much benefit. Over the last 1 month, the severity of the pain was so bad that the patient had to stand all the time and sitting or decubitus position was not tolerable even for 1 min. His sleep was so miserable that he had been taking small naps in that standing position leaning onto some support. He had carcinoma rectum for which he underwent abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago. There was history of smoking prior to that. After the surgery, he had been leading a near normal life driving auto rickshaw for a living until he developed the present problem. There were many gangrenous ulcers over his right thigh and leg. A computed tomography-angiogram was done previously that showed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery measuring about 9.5 cm extending up to the right superficial femoral artery with a near total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals. He was scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram for deciding on the further plan. However, he could not lie down in the catheterization laboratory due to severe pain and was referred to our Department of Pain Management. We initially tried a conservative approach with a combination of oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol as per the standard dosage protocol for 2 days. When there was no satisfactory pain relief, we planned epidural analgesia. However, the problem here was the positioning. Patient was not able to tolerate either sitting or lateral decubitus position even for 1 min. He was somewhat comfortable only in the standing position. Considering the special situation, though not conventional, we decided to place the epidural catheter in that standing position. An intravenous line was started using an 18G venous cannula. Electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and non-invasive blood pressure monitors were connected. Patient was made to stand besides the operating table holding on to it for support. He was also supported by a technician from the front []. After painting and draping the back, L 4-5 inter-space was identified and local anesthesia was given with 2% lidocaine. Epidural space was engaged with 18G Tuohy needle using loss of resistance to air technique. The epidural catheter was carefully threaded and placed such that the length of the catheter was 5 cm in the epidural space. Catheter was gently aspirated to check for blood and cerebro-spinal fluid and was fixed after subcutaneous tunneling for about 5 cm []. Patient was reassured and gently placed on the operating table in the supine position. A quick test dose was given with 3 ml of 2% lidocaine with 15 mcg adrenaline confirming the epidural placement followed by a bolus of 10 ml of 1% lidocaine along with 1 ml of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. The pain was relieved within 1 min and the vital signs were stable. Epidural infusion was maintained thereafter with a solution of 0.125% bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/ml at the rate of 5 ml/h. Patient was very comfortable and slept peacefully. Next day peripheral angiogram was performed, which confirmed the findings of CT-angiogram. Balloon angioplasty was attempted after 2 days, but was not successful and an above knee amputation was performed subsequently. Epidural catheter was removed after 2 days and further pain control was achieved satisfactorily with oral medications.","{

"Our patient is a 38-year-old male who presented with right chest wall and shoulder pain after a weight lifting injury. The patient was performing a one-rep max bench press when he felt a pop in his right upper arm, accompanied by severe pain. There was no history of anabolic steroid use. He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ). He was scheduled for surgery in five days. Two days later, the patient returned to our facility with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm. Intracompartmental pressure readings in the anterior compartment of the arm taken about the midpoint of the biceps at the point of maximal swelling were 37, 39, and 42 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure of 71 mmHg (). Thus, with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome confirmed, we proceeded to the operating room for an emergency fasciotomy with repair of the pectoralis major tendon rupture.\nAn extended deltopectoral approach was used, and the deltopectoral and biceps fascia were released. Immediately, a large amount of hematoma was expelled and the muscle bellies visibly bulged from the incision sites (Figures and ). All muscles still appeared viable. No apparent vascular damage was noted. Upon further dissection, both heads of the pectoralis major were found to be avulsed from the proximal humerus (). After preparation of the footprint with curette and rongeur, three double-loaded 4.5 mm Mitek suture anchors (DePuy Synthes, Raynham, MA) were placed lateral to the bicipital groove for the repair of the tendon. The proximal and distal suture anchors were used such that one suture of each was run in a Krakow fashion along the superior and inferior aspects of the tendon, respectively. The remaining suture from each of those anchors was passed in a horizontal mattress fashion medial to the Krakow stitches. The middle suture anchor was used to place a horizontal mattress stitch with a medial ripstop stitch (). The wound was irrigated, and a negative pressure dressing was applied. The patient was made nonweightbearing and placed in a sling with a circumferential strap to ensure adduction of the arm. The patient returned to the operating room four days later to undergo irrigation and debridement with a tension-free primary wound closure. He was again placed into his sling and given strict instructions to avoid abduction and external rotation of the arm. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home in a stable condition that same day with a one-week follow-up appointment. He continued to do well and was instructed to remain nonweightbearing in his sling for a total of 6 weeks before beginning formal therapy. Gentle stretching and passive range of motion were then begun, followed by strengthening exercises at the 12th week mark. At his four-month follow-up, the patient had active forward flexion of the shoulder to 150°, abduction to 150°, and external rotation of 50°. His rotator cuff, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors, and interossei all demonstrated 5/5 strength. There were no sensory deficits on examination. He continues to attend therapy for motion and strengthening and has a lifting restriction of <5 pounds at work.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Dysphagia and neck pain after multiple cervical spine surgeries', 'Persistent dysphagia and pain for approximately 3 years', 'Recent low-energy fall with concerns for esophageal perforation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'RheumatoidArthritis': True, 'SurgeryHistory': ['ACDF from C5 to C7 in 2009', 'Revision extension ACDF from C3 to C7 in 2010']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Plain film radiography', 'Finding': 'Nonhealing posterior pseudarthrosis, screw loosening, plate migration'}, {'Test': 'CT-Scan', 'Finding': 'Air communicating with the plate, esophageal perforation concern'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Posterior pharyngeal wall defect with chronic erosion', 'Type': 'Complication of previous cervical spine surgeries', 'Location': 'Cervical spine'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Neck exploration, hardware removal, staged revision extension fusion', 'Details': 'Pharyngeal defect reconstruction, C3-C4 osteotomy, posterior spinal fusion'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Gradual improvement in pain and dysphagia', 'DischargeStatus': 'Transferred to skilled nursing facility for recovery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Up to 8 months postoperatively', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved swallowing ability, advanced diet to regular diet'}}}"
"A 31-year-old man presented with severe episodic, lancinating right-sided facial pain in the distribution of the mandibular nerve and with less severity in the distribution of the maxillary nerve of 6-month duration. The pain was associated with numbness of the right side of his face, especially in the vicinity of the mandibular nerve which could be triggered with drinking cold water. Considering his poor orodental hygiene, decayed teeth had been diagnosed to be the cause of pain and lead to the extraction of several of the right upper and lower teeth while he was also treated with antibiotics for gingivitis for a long period of time.\nTwo days before admission, he developed generalized tonic colonic seizure. Neurological examination revealed bilateral papilledema and mild paresthesia detectable along the distribution area of the mandibular nerve especially over the labial commissure. MRI revealed a large right temporal mass with nonhomogenous postcontrast enhancement, invading the wall of the right cavernous sinus, and spreading down to the right CPA. The enhancing bundle in the right CPA was compatible with the thickened course of the fifth nerve extending to the surface of the pons [Figures and ].\nA right temporal craniotomy was performed and a solid fleshy tumor infiltrating the dura of the floor of the right temporal fossa and lateral wall of the cavernous sinus could be resected as much as possible. The deepest part of the tumor could be excised as a layer of the tumor infiltrating the surface of the cavernous sinus. We stopped just over the tentorium and no dissection was done beyond this point. The contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI performed in the postoperative period revealed a minimal residual tumor in the right CPA, located along the course of the right trigeminal nerve [].\nThe postoperative course was uneventful and a histopathological examination revealed the tumor to be GBM. The patient received postoperative whole brain radiotherapy. Five weeks after surgery, the patient was pain free but numbness of the face persisted for another 6 months. The patient died 17 months after surgery with tumor recurrence.","{

"The patient was a 61-day-old girl. She was born at a gestational age of 37 weeks and had a birth weight of 2.41 kg. She had a slightly high galactose concentration on mass screening for congenital metabolic abnormalities at 4 days of age. She was examined at another hospital at 13 days of age, when she exhibited white feces and a high circulating direct bilirubin concentration. Her gallbladder could not be identified by abdominal ultrasonography; therefore, biliary atresia was suspected. At the age of 39 days, bile excretion was not observed on hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy at the previous hospital had not confirmed excretion into the intestinal tract. Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and the circumstances of the family, her referral to our hospital was slightly delayed. The patient was admitted to our department at the age of 57 days and underwent exploratory laparotomy at the age of 61 days, when she was diagnosed with type III biliary atresia (the type of extrahepatic biliary obstruction was determined using the Japanese Society of Pediatric Surgeons Classification\n) using intraoperative cholangiography (\n) and underwent open KPE using the 8K UHD television system.\nA right subcostal laparotomy was performed and intraoperative cholangiography was performed via the atrophied gallbladder. Only the gallbladder could be detected, and the contrast agent leaked from the lateral aspect under compression. A diagnosis of type III biliary atresia was made on the basis of the cholangiographic and gross findings, and open KPE was performed.\nThe connective tissue in the portal region was dissected using Metzenbaum scissors at the level of the hepatic capsule, from the medial side of the left portal vein toward the medial side of the right portal vein, while applying gauze saturated with warm physiological saline to aid hemostasis.\nAt that time, the site of dissection was confirmed by examining the portal region using the camera of the 8K UHD laparoscopic system, and the biliary outflow site was examined after dissection. Bile outflow near the right hepatic artery was observed in 8K UHD mode (\n,\nand\n), but was not visible in high-definition mode (\n).\nThe jejunum was separated at a point 30 cm from the ligament of Treitz, an ascending limb of 40 cm in length was elevated in front of the colon, and portoenterostomy was performed. The jejunum was anastomosed to the\nporta hepatis\nusing 5–0 PDS II, which sufficiently covered the biliary outflow site (\n).\nThe biliary tract was reconstructed using the Roux-en-Y procedure, with the creation of a Nakajo-type enteric antireflux valve at a point 10 cm toward the liver from the Roux-en-Y limb and the Roux-en-Y limb was secured at an acute angle by suturing the seromuscular layer, to prevent food reflux. We performed an antireflux plasty using the intussuscepted valve Roux-en-Y procedure, according to the technique performed at Tohoku University Hospital.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. Oral feeding was initiated on postoperative day (POD) 3, and the drain was removed on POD 6. Steroid administration was started, according to the protocol of the Japanese Biliary Atresia Society, on POD 7, and the patient was discharged on POD 17 with a total bilirubin concentration of 2.4 mg/dL. Thereafter, the patient was followed up on an outpatient basis, involving weekly attendance at the clinic during the immediate period following discharge, and once monthly visits when her blood parameters had normalized. She was initially followed up by both a pediatric surgeon and a pediatrician, but in the longer term she is being monitored principally by a pediatric surgeon. At the time of writing (POD 115), no cholangitis has been noted and her total bilirubin concentration is 0.5 mg/dL (\n).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Presented with melena'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Large submucosal tumor in the gastric body with concomitant bleeding from a central ulceration'}, {'Test': 'Endoscopic ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Large submucosal mass in the gastric body'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal CT scan', 'Finding': '5.5 × 3.2 cm well-defined mass arising from the posterior aspect of the lesser curvature side in the gastric body'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Solitary fibrous tumor', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Gastric body'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach', 'Details': 'Removal of the tumor under general anesthesia'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Melena resolved', 'DischargeStatus': 'No evidence of recurrence or metastasis after one year of follow-up'}}}"
"This case features a 73-year-old male patient from the department of neurosurgery who experienced vomiting after taking medication on March 9, 2015. A physician could use the proposed system for this patient following the four steps outlined in . The six drugs amongst the list of drugs that the patient was taking on the symptom start date, were found to be related to vomiting according to the database. Among the six drugs, Tramadol HCI was the most highly ranked according to the decision tree model, and thus would have been recommended as the main culprit drug. In addition to the name of candidate drugs/substances, the system displayed more information on the drug such as the frequency and severity of the symptom. The physician could have chosen any drug from the list of recommendations based on past treatments and medications on the particular patient. In this case, the physician would have accepted the recommendation, and hence entered a prescription change for the selected drug in step 3. Finally, the physician would have reported the outcome of the prescription change a few days later, i.e., assessment of the causality between vomiting and Tramadol HCI as probable/likely (50%). This result would have been stored and used later for patients with symptoms and demographics similar to the ones of this patient.\npresents the decision tree and the rules that were used to provide the recommendations. This shows how the six drugs were ranked as listed in step 2 (), more specifically why Tramadol HCI was recommended as the most likely cause of an adverse event. According to the decision tree, medical department was the most important factor to identify ADE causative drugs. If we consider the case of the patients from the department of neurosurgery, there were only two patients in the same group as the patient of case 1 (i.e., age between 71 and 80 and gender=male) due to a limited dataset. While not enough data are available, the highlighted rule clearly shows that a patient similar to both of them may also have had vomiting after taking Tramadol HCI with 100% confidence.","{

"A 41-year-old man had been diagnosed as having a middle esophageal diverticulum based on an upper gastrointestinal contrast examination performed when he was 30 years old. He had not received treatment because he was asymptomatic. Eight months earlier, he experienced chest discomfort after eating and visited our hospital. His past history is pediatric asthma. The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position and four trocars inserted into the right thoracic cavity. A 12-mm trocar was inserted into the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. Only the left lung was ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest was created using CO2 gas at 6 mm. Twelve-mm trocars were inserted into the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle. A 5-mm trocar was then inserted into the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the ninth intercostal space at the level of the inferior scapular angle. The operator used the 12-mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the inferior scapular angle line and the 5 mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The assistant used the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The endoscope was inserted into the lumen of the upper thoracic esophagus before the patient was placed in the prone position and kept in the esophagus throughout the surgery. Confirmation of the middle esophageal diverticulum was easily achieved, but the area was difficult to exfoliate because the diverticular wall had adhered to the lymph nodes of the trachea bifurcation. To achieve a complete resection of the diverticulum, threads were placed on the oral and anal sides of the diverticulum, the threads were pulled. A thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line and the surgical stapler was inserted via the 12-mm port placed in the ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle, and the diverticulum was resected using two sets of the Tri-Stapler (Fig. ). A postoperative upper gastrointestinal contrast examination revealed no abnormalities (Fig. ). Oral intake was initiated on postoperative day 7, and he was discharged on postoperative day 12. The histopathological findings were a true diverticulum with a muscular layer and a highly inflamed mucosa. No malignant findings were seen (Fig. ). Postoperatively, the patient visited the hospital at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the surgery. He underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal contrast examination 1 year after the surgery. We found no evidence of recurrence of the esophageal diverticulum. We are planning to repeat the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 2 years after the surgery.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Persistent orocutaneous fistula following previous surgeries'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Plasmacytoma enucleation from the medial side of the left mandible'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': '3 × 2 cm diameter defect between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Orocotaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Complication', 'Location': 'Medial side of the left mandible'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Submandibular gland pedicled flap reconstruction', 'Details': 'Exicision of fistula, preparation of oral and cutaneous healthy tissues, mobilization and rotation of submandibular gland, closure of flaps'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Ideal closure of the fistula observed'}}}"
"A 75 year old lady was referred to the Orthopaedic Outpatients Department with a painless, slowly growing mass on the dorsum of the right wrist. She first noticed the swelling a year previously and attended her local doctor who felt it was a ganglion. Past medical history included hypertension, osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and malunion of a right distal radius following a distal radius fracture sustained 5 months prior for which she declined surgical intervention (,). Clinical examination revealed a radially deviated wrist with a classic dinner fork deformity. There was a 6 X 9 cm round painless mass on the dorsum of the distal radius adherent to both the underlying structures and skin which did not transilluminate and with necrotic area of overlying skin (,). General physical e x a m i n a t i o n w a s u n r e m a r k a b l e w i t h n o o b v i o u s lymphadenopathy, no breast masses, no organomegaly and clear lung fields. Her right hand had capillary refill of under 2 seconds, palpable radial and ulnar pulses and normal sensory and motor exams. Mantoux test was negative making TB an unlikely cause. Blood count, renal and liver function were within normal range, ESR 74 (elevated), haemoglobin 11 g/dl. On ultrasound scan there was a large vascularised soft tissue mass infiltrating the tendinous structures on the dorsum of the right wrist. MRI of the wrist showed a large mass causing extensive osteolysis of the distal radius and extending proximally with abnormal replacement of the marrow in the distal one third of the radius. The soft tissue component of the mass involved the entire extensor tendon groups and infiltrated through the subcutaneous tissues to the dermis (,,). CT thorax abdomen and pelvis and whole body bone scan confirmed that this was an isolated lesion with no evidence of dissemination. The patient was brought to theatre for biopsy following consultation from the National Musculoskeletal Tumour Centre. Subsequent histopathological examination confirmed a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma -DLBCL- right wrist-stage 1EA). The patient was referred to the Haematology Service for further treatment and follow-up. She received chemotherapy (R-C H O P C6 plus Rituximab and R-CHOP C4) and radiotherapy (IFRT) with satisfactory results that caused the mass to shrink considerably (more than 50% after the first cycle of radiotherapy) and subsequent CT scans didn’t show any evidence of metastases. Despite her good response to the therapy, this lady died from causes not related to her primary diagnosis (pulmonary embolism).","{

"A 68-year-old man with no significant medical problems was referred by his primary care physician with a 6-month history of a painful right hip. The pain was localized above the right hip joint and a mass with bony consistency was palpable just above the anterior superior iliac spine. On pelvic x-ray (Fig. ) an exostosis overlying the lateral superior border of the right iliac bone was seen and radiological features on magnetic resonance imaging scan (Fig. ) were in keeping with an osteosarcoma. Biochemical markers including a serum prostate specific antigen concentration was within normal limits. Subsequent biopsy and histopathological analysis of this lesion performed at the regional sarcoma centre showed this to be an adenocarcinoma of metastatic origin. On further staining there were features to suggest mucin production and it was positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) suggesting a colorectal origin (Figs and ) thereby ruling out a sarcoma. CK20 is a marker of intestinal differentiation, and its expression is highly characteristic of colorectal primary. CDX2 protein is a member of the homeobox genes that encodes an intestine-specific transcription factor and it is an excellent marker for adenocarcinomas arising from the colon.\nStaging computerized tomography scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (Fig. ) did not reveal a primary source but identified thickening of the ascending colon. A subsequent colonoscopy (Figs and ) identified this thickened area as a hepatic flexure adenocarcinoma with mucin production confirmed on histopathological analysis ( and ). Comparison with the histopathology from the bone biopsy confirmed that the bone lesion was a secondary deposit from the colonic adenocarcinoma. Our patient did not have any other clinical or radiological evidence of metastatic spread to other organs like liver, lung or indeed other bones. On further analysis of the colonic tumour it was found that there was no pathogenic mutation in the K-RAS and N-RAS gene.\nThis is a report of an unusual presentation of metastatic colonic cancer as a solitary bony lesion mimicking a sarcoma. The patient was subsequently referred to the local oncological services and has since been commenced on palliative chemotherapy. He has remained well, tolerated chemotherapy without undue side effects and is due a computed tomography scan to assess response to chemotherapy. Radiotherapy to the bony metastasis has been planned at a later stage.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain and discharge in the upper left back region of the jaw since one and half years', 'Pain continued even after extraction of maxillary molars one year prior'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None', 'MedicalConditions': ['Hypertension (since three years)', 'Former smoking habit']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Complete obliteration of the left maxillary sinus'}, {'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Diagnosis of ADCC (cribriform pattern)'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'ADCC (Acinar cell cystadenocarcinoma)', 'Type': 'Malignant neoplasm', 'Location': 'Maxillary sinus and palate region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Wide surgical excision with clear margins and hemi-maxillectomy', 'Details': 'Post-radiotherapy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Disease-free at one-year follow-up', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Regular follow-up', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Disease-free'}}}"
"We report the case of a 13-year-old boy who fell down during a skiing trip. He developed left hip pain that prevented him from weight bearing on the affected limb. The patient was Caucasian, had a body mass index (BMI)<20 and no history of endocrinopathy. The patient was evaluated by an orthopaedic surgeon who diagnosed him with an acute unstable SCFE and took the patient to surgery for a percutaneous in-situ fixation. The procedure was uncomplicated with appropriate center-center positioning of the screw within the head and epiphysis [ and ]. The patient returned home with his family at the conclusion of their vacation and followed up with a local orthopaedic surgeon (senior author).\nAt 3 weeks he was ambulating without difficulty when he developed recurrent pain and inability to weight-bear. New X-rays were obtained that demonstrated failure of the hardware with progression of the SCFE displacement, with a Grade 3 slip angle measured at 60 degrees [ and ]. The patient was taken back to surgery for hardware removal and revision closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of the SCFE. Surgical dislocation of the hip with hardware removal, open reduction and pinning was the also listed on the consent if the closed procedure failed. Insitu pinning and remodeling was deemed unlikely to have a successful outcome due to less then 3 years remaining until the patient turned 16 and the patient already achieving nearly the same height as his father and skeletally mature older brother.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and placed on a fracture table in the supine position. Under fluoroscopic guidance minimal traction was applied to the left leg through the boot harness and the leg was internally rotated so that on both AP and lateral images the long axis of the screw shaft and the distal screw fragment within the epiphysis were co-axial. A guide wire was then threaded back through the screw allowing the cannulated screw driver to be easily seated within the screw head and the proximal screw fragment was removed.\nA cannulated Conical Extraction Screw (Synthes (r) Screw Extraction Set) commonly referred to as an “Easy Out” device () was then inserted over the guide-wire into the fractured distal screw fragment within the epiphysis through tract left after the removal of the proximal screw fragment. The sharp reversed threads of the of the Conical Extraction Screw / Easy Out allows this device to gain purchase in the fractured screw fragment and then back the screw fragment out. Once the screw fragment was removed from the epiphysis three trans physeal 7.0mm screws were placed for improved fixation strength of the SCFE.\nAt 2 weeks post-op the patient had all restrictions lifted and returned to normal activities without pain. Follow-up at 9 months demonstrated a fused physis and no signs of avascular necrosis of the femoral head.","{

"A 73-year old female patient 150 cm tall and weighing 50 kg visited our hospital presenting with the complaints of lower back pain and radiating pain to right lower extremity. The lower back pain started when the patient fell down nine years ago. At first, mild lower back pain had occurred from time to time, but severe pain with a visual analogue score (VAS) of 8 or higher started to occur three months prior to her visit. The patient did not have any particular medical history except osteoporosis diagnosed in her late fifties. She felt pain as if her body was collapsing or sinking, accompanied by pulling pain at the hip and groin. The pain became more severe when standing up and moving, and relieved when lying down at rest. The physical examination showed tenderness at the first lumbar (L1) spinous process region. There were no abnormal findings in any other neurological examinations. The plain radiograph showed severe osteoporosis over the vertebral bodies, a severe compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body in which the anterior compression rate was 70% or higher, and an intravertebral vacuum cleft in the vertebral body (). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a low signal area of L1 in the T1 weighted image and a high signal in the T2 weighted image ().\nDespite conservative treatment for more than four weeks including continuous epidural pain control, the patient's pain did not decrease and she was rejecting surgical procedures such as a spinal fusion. Although the case was not a general indication of percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty due to the severe collapse of the vertebral body, we decided to do transpedicular kyphoplasty using this method to block the cement outflow by slowly injecting highly viscous bone cement.\nBefore the procedure, cefazolin 1 g was intravenously injected to the patient as a preventive antibiotic. We had the patient take the prone position, supporting her abdomen with a pillow, in order to reduce abdominal lordosis. To check the patient's state during the procedure, we monitored the blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, with supplement of oxygen through a nasal cannula. The skin on the area to be operated on was aseptically prepared and draped. For the sake of sedation and analgesia during the procedure, when needed, we injected fentanyl intravenously with a total of 100 µg. Using the C-arm image, we verified the pedicle of L1 and determined a working cannula implantation position and angle. Local infiltration anesthesia was performed with 1% lidocaine on the expected cannula implantation pathway. Under fluoroscopic C-arm guidance, we implanted the cannula into the fractured vertebral body through the vertebral pedicle. At the moment when the left cannula was inserted into the vertebral body, air flowed into the vertebral body with a popping sound, and the level of the vertebral body recovered spontaneously (). The cannula was also inserted into the right side, and balloons were inflated with a pressure of 50-100 psi to recover the level of vertebral body. Then, 4.5 ml of bone cement was slowly injected through each side of cannulas through the L1 vertebral body (). While injecting the bone cement, cement leakage out of the vertebral body was meticulously examined in both posteroanterior and lateral fluoroscopic views. The kyphoplasty was successfully implemented without cement leakage or clinical problems. The patient was discharged after the procedure without any particular abnormal findings. After the procedure, the VAS of the patient was 2, indicating that the preoperative pain almost disappeared. Currently, the patient during follow-up visits has not received any particular treatments except for the medication for osteoporosis.","{

"A British Caucasian female patient aged 10 years and 11 months presented to our institution with a thoracic and lumbar scoliosis. She was noted to have the phenotypic features indicative of Smith-Magenis syndrome at the age of three years and the diagnosis was confirmed with chromosomal studies. There was no family history of syndromic conditions or scoliosis.\nThe development of a scoliosis was first noted at the age of 4 years and the patient was treated with an underarm spinal brace in another spinal centre. The deformity remained stable up to the age of 10 years when the curvature progressed rapidly as the patient started going through her pubertal growth spurt. During that stage, the brace was discontinued as the patient's compliance was very poor and any brace effectiveness was limited due to the fact that the patient was significantly overweight. At presentation to our clinic, she remained premenarchal with a body weight of 63 kg which was above the 95th percentile for sex- and age-matched normal population. Her arm span was 142 cm which was between the 25th and 50th percentiles for stature and her BMI was calculated to be 31.2.\nOn clinical examination, the patient was found to be very hyperactive. Overall, she had a balanced spine with level shoulders and pelvis despite a mild thoracic translocation to the right and no leg length discrepancy. However, she had a severe thoracic and lumbar deformity with a significant rib hump adjacent to the convexity of the thoracic scoliosis, as well as a marked waist line asymmetry with prominence of the pelvis on the concavity of the lumbar curve. There were no skin or soft tissue abnormalities overlying the spine. The patient was a community ambulator and had no neurological abnormality. Neurological examination showed normal tone, muscle power, sensation and tendon reflexes in the upper and lower limbs, as well as symmetrically elicited abdominal reflexes. There were no upper motor neurone signs.\nRadiographs of the spine during the initial assessment in our clinic revealed a right thoracic scoliosis extending from T4 to T10 and measuring 75° and a left lumbar scoliosis extending from T11 to L4 and measuring 65°. Both curvatures were rigid on supine maximum side-bending and traction radiographs. The radiological evaluation excluded the presence of congenital abnormalities in the development of the vertebral column and the chest wall. There were no features suggestive of congenital spinal stenosis and the interpedicular distance was within normal limits. The Risser grade was 0, indicating that the patient had a significant amount of remaining growth and this could result into further deterioration of her scoliosis.\nAn MRI of the spine demonstrated no intraspinal anomalies, normal appearance of the pedicles, no evidence of spinal stenosis, and normal kidneys. An ultrasound of the kidneys and the bladder did not elicit pathological findings. A cardiological examination showed normal cardiac function. A respiratory assessment did not identify any abnormality. An anaesthetic evaluation confirmed the fitness of the patient to undergo scoliosis surgery and excluded laryngeal anomalies that could complicate intubation. Blood tests demonstrated lower than normal immunoglobulin levels.\nOur patient underwent a posterior spinal arthrodesis extending from T3 to L4 with a double pedicle hook/screw and rod construct six months following initial clinical assessment and while the scoliosis had further progressed (Figure ). An interfacetal and intertransverse arthrodesis was performed bilaterally at every level across the instrumentation using iliac crest graft supplemented by allograft bone. Spinal cord monitoring was performed during the surgery recording somatosensory (SSEP) and motor (MEP) evoked potentials and there were no problems.\nContinuous arterial line blood pressure, as well as ECG monitoring was performed throughout the procedure. Central venous access was also placed to allow for rapid administration of fluids and blood products. Intraoperative blood conservation techniques were applied with the use of a cell saver. Three doses of a first generation cephalosporin were administered immediate preoperatively, at completion of surgery and eight hours later as per routine protocol in our institution.\nIn order to avoid problems related to patient's hyperactivity, as well as her tendency towards a self-injurious behaviour, the period of sedation and assistive ventilation after scoliosis surgery was electively prolonged. The patient was extubated three days following the procedure. During this initial postoperative period nutrition was maintained with nasogastric feeding. She was fitted with a plastazote spinal brace in order to provide additional support to the spine and limit spinal mobility. Six days following surgery, our patient developed a superficial dehiscence of the distal third of the spinal wound; this was treated with resuturing and healed without further problems. There was no sign of a wound infection and both the blood and wound cultures were negative.\nPostoperative radiographs showed correction of the thoracic scoliosis from 85° to 45° and the lumbar scoliosis from 80° to 40° with a balanced spine in the coronal and sagittal planes (Figure ). The patient was discharged 10 days after the initial procedure. At the latest follow-up four years following surgery, the patient had no complaints of her back and had a good level of activities within the limitations of her condition. She was skeletally mature as determined by the Risser grade which was 5. There was no loss of scoliosis correction across the instrumented levels and no detected pseudarthrosis. There was also no evidence of add-on deformity either above or below the levels of the spinal fusion.","{

"A 32-year-old premenopausal female presented to the outpatient department in our hospital with a 1-year history of a mass in her right breast and eruption of the mass through the skin for last 3 months. She reported acceleration in the growth of the mass in the recent months. She also complained of pain and occasional bleeding from the mass. There was no personal or family history of breast cancer. The patient had noticed the mass more than one year before presenting but had sought help of alternative medicine (homeopathy) in her village and was on homeopathic medication for almost a year. The size of the lump did reduce initially, but she did not notice any improvement after a year of therapy; instead the mass grew more rapidly and erupted through the skin. She delayed medical attention because she was not comfortable discussing her condition. She sought help when the mass erupted through the skin and caused pain.\nPhysical examination presented a hanging mass which was ulcerated, having irregular surface and nodular appearance, occupying the lower and outer quadrant of the right breast (). The right breast was asymmetrically drawn down by the mass, which was firm in consistency and was found attached to the underlying structures by a stalk-like process. The mass bled on touch. There was no discharge from the nipple and retraction of nipple was also absent. There were no signs of skin involvement or axillary lymphadenomegaly. The left breast was normal.\nThe patient was subjected to diagnostic investigations which included routine as well as imaging and cytological modalities. Blood examination revealed no abnormality except mildly elevated ESR and all other parameters were within normal limits. Ultrasonography reported the mass as an exophytic growth with heterogeneous echotexture and vascularity. Chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound were performed which showed no abnormality. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was inconclusive. We suspected a case of Phyllodes tumor owing to the nature and rapid growth of the breast mass and planned an excisional biopsy. The patient underwent wide excision of the mass under general anesthesia; we took a one-centimeter margin from the clinically palpable periphery of the tumour (Figures and ). The resected specimen was 9.5 × 8.5 × 4.5 cm in size and the tumor was not invasive to the surrounding tissues. The specimen was sent for histopathology macroscopic examination evidenced a nodular mass with irregular and ulcerated surface. The anatomopathologic analysis of the surgical specimen revealed epithelial-lined cystic spaces into which the hypercellular stroma was projected, the stroma cellularity was low with mild pleomorphism and low mitotic activity, features compatible with benign Phyllodes tumor (), confirming the initial diagnosis.\nThe post-operative course of our patient was uneventful, and she was discharged on 10th post-operative day in a fairly good condition. Regular follow-up was advised and subsequently the patient was seen every three months and a clinical examination was carried out. Nine months after surgery, no recurrence was reported.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Dizziness and gait ataxia', 'Headache', 'Hearing loss and aural pressure in left ear', 'Aural discharge'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': True, 'Diabetes': True}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Brain CT', 'Finding': 'Formation of a 5x5cm wall-enhancing lesion in left cerebellum pressing brain stem and fourth ventricle'}, {'Test': 'Temporal Bone CT', 'Finding': 'Overall destruction of cochlea and vestibular organ in left ear caused by cholesteatoma'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Otitis media cholesteatomatica', 'Type': 'Invasive ear infection', 'Location': 'Left ear with cerebellar abscess and labyrinth invasion'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Craniotomy and drainage of abscess, tympanomastoidectomy', 'Details': 'Removal of cholesteatoma and granulation tissue from left ear'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Without neurological sequela', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged from hospital'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Currently under observation', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Awaiting follow-up CT without relapse'}}}"
"Our patient is a 38-year-old male who presented with right chest wall and shoulder pain after a weight lifting injury. The patient was performing a one-rep max bench press when he felt a pop in his right upper arm, accompanied by severe pain. There was no history of anabolic steroid use. He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ). He was scheduled for surgery in five days. Two days later, the patient returned to our facility with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm. Intracompartmental pressure readings in the anterior compartment of the arm taken about the midpoint of the biceps at the point of maximal swelling were 37, 39, and 42 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure of 71 mmHg (). Thus, with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome confirmed, we proceeded to the operating room for an emergency fasciotomy with repair of the pectoralis major tendon rupture.\nAn extended deltopectoral approach was used, and the deltopectoral and biceps fascia were released. Immediately, a large amount of hematoma was expelled and the muscle bellies visibly bulged from the incision sites (Figures and ). All muscles still appeared viable. No apparent vascular damage was noted. Upon further dissection, both heads of the pectoralis major were found to be avulsed from the proximal humerus (). After preparation of the footprint with curette and rongeur, three double-loaded 4.5 mm Mitek suture anchors (DePuy Synthes, Raynham, MA) were placed lateral to the bicipital groove for the repair of the tendon. The proximal and distal suture anchors were used such that one suture of each was run in a Krakow fashion along the superior and inferior aspects of the tendon, respectively. The remaining suture from each of those anchors was passed in a horizontal mattress fashion medial to the Krakow stitches. The middle suture anchor was used to place a horizontal mattress stitch with a medial ripstop stitch (). The wound was irrigated, and a negative pressure dressing was applied. The patient was made nonweightbearing and placed in a sling with a circumferential strap to ensure adduction of the arm. The patient returned to the operating room four days later to undergo irrigation and debridement with a tension-free primary wound closure. He was again placed into his sling and given strict instructions to avoid abduction and external rotation of the arm. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home in a stable condition that same day with a one-week follow-up appointment. He continued to do well and was instructed to remain nonweightbearing in his sling for a total of 6 weeks before beginning formal therapy. Gentle stretching and passive range of motion were then begun, followed by strengthening exercises at the 12th week mark. At his four-month follow-up, the patient had active forward flexion of the shoulder to 150°, abduction to 150°, and external rotation of 50°. His rotator cuff, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors, and interossei all demonstrated 5/5 strength. There were no sensory deficits on examination. He continues to attend therapy for motion and strengthening and has a lifting restriction of <5 pounds at work.","{

"We report the case of a 42-year-old woman who underwent orthotopic renal transplantation for the first time, using a kidney from her sister. The patient had developed end-stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis. She had a medical history of bilateral thrombosis of both common and external iliac arteries due to lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies that had required bilateral percutaneous angioplasty with wall stenting. The medical workup had documented thrombosis of both iliac veins and of the lower portion of the lower part of the inferior vena cava as well as extensive atherosclerotic lesions of the abdominal aorta. In addition, she had a history of mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude prosthetic valve and received anticoagulation therapy with acenocoumarol.\nThe patient had an HLA semi-identical sister who was willing to donate a kidney. The donor workup had documented a slightly lower tubular mass of the right kidney which was chosen for procurement. The “classic” extraperitoneal pelvic transplantation of a kidney graft was contraindicated because of stented iliac arteries and extended atheromatosis of the aorta (). An alternative surgical technique with the transplantation of the graft into the location of a native kidney was proposed to the recipient and her sister who both consented to the procedure. Mapping CT-angiography of the recipient showed that the left renal artery was appropriated for anastomosis with the graft artery. At the same time the anatomical variant of the left recipient renal vein was found with low implantation to vein cava inferior (VCI; ).\nThe graft was procured by laparoscopic right donor transperitoneal nephrectomy with utilization of linear stapler Endo-GIA as previously described []. The warm ischemic time was 3 minutes measured from the first clip applied to the renal artery until the kidney was perfused with preservation solution. The graft was cold flushed with HTK solution and preserved on ice during the left nephrectomy of the recipient. The total duration of the donor nephrectomy was 95 minutes and total blood loss due to the procedure was 25 mL. The donor was discharged at day 4 after the nephrectomy.\nThe recipient was placed in a modified lateral decubitus position and flexed for hyperextension of the left flank. Pneumoperitoneum was established via a Veress needle placed two fingerbreaths below the left costal margin, at the level of the lateral border of the rectus muscle, which was replaced by a 10 mm port for a 0-degree lens optic. Under direct vision the 10 mm trocar for a bipolar grasper, two 5 mm trocar for the monopolar scissors and for a suction device were inserted. The descending colon and the spleen were dissected from the underlying Gerota's fascia. Following the medial mobilization of the colon and the mesocolon, the gonadal vessels were visualized and preserved during operation. The fatty tissue at the level of the lower pole of the kidney was incised and lifted to locate the psoas muscle. By tracking the cephalic course of the ureter, the plane was followed up to the renal pedicle. The left renal vein is dissected and gently displaced till its low implantation in VCI to expose the required length and visualize lumbar and adrenal branches. At this level, the left renal artery was dissected and exposed from its origin to the first bifurcation. The adrenal gland was preserved and separated from the kidney. The posterior and lateral attachments of the kidney to the abdominal wall are released by blunt and sharp dissection. Then two trocar ports under the left costal margin were joined by a 2.5 inch (6 cm) incision to access the left recipient kidney. The kidney was attached only to the hilum. The artery and the vein were clamped using bulldog clamps and the pedicle was divided close to the hilum. The ureter was sectioned at the level of the pyeloureteral junction and the kidney was removed.\nThe native renal vessels were found to be sufficient and were used for the end-to-end anastomoses with prolene 6/00 for the artery and prolene 5/00 for the vein.\nThe left native ureter was then spatulated and anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion to the transplant ureter with vicryl 3–0, over double J stent. A lombonephropexy of the graft was performed and a silicone Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted. The abdominal wall was closed using running vicryl 2–0 suture for the peritoneum, interrupted vicryl 0 suture for the muscle, and running vicryl 1 for the aponeurosis, and the skin incisions were closed with intradermal suture. The second warm ischemia time was 17 minutes and blood loss in the recipient was 15 mL.\nAt the moment of transplantation, the patient had maintenance immunosuppression with azathioprine and steroids for her systemic lupus erythematosus. Basiliximab and tacrolimus were added for prevention of acute graft rejection. The patient had delayed graft function up to day 4 but did not require renal replacement therapy because of the residual function of her native kidney. Anticoagulation consisted first of low molecular weight heparine (enoxaparin 20 mg per day) with resumption of acenocoumarol on postoperative day 6. The only medical complication was a urinary infection with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa treated with ciprofloxacine. The patient left the department two weeks after transplantation with a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. The double-J stent was removed 4 weeks after transplantation. Three months after transplantation a control angio-MRI showed normal a normal kidney and graft vessels (). At this moment the serum creatinine level and glomerular filtration rate were 1.0 mg/dL and 58 mL/min/1.732, respectively.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Dysuria and intermittent hematuria for 2 years'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Insertion of two IUDs, with the second IUD causing persistent urinary symptoms'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal Ultrasonography', 'Finding': 'Echogenic intravesical lesion measuring 27 mm with distal acoustic shadow'}, {'Test': 'Transvaginal Ultrasonography', 'Finding': 'Partially embedded intravesical IUD on the posterior bladder wall with stone formation'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Intravesical IUD with stone formation', 'Type': 'Foreign body complication', 'Location': 'Bladder'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Endoscopic surgery with holmium laser lithotripsy', 'Details': 'Complete disintegration and extraction of stone and IUD through cystoscope'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Normal physical examination and urinalysis at first and third month follow-up visits'}}}"
"A 1-month-old female infant attended a private dental office accompanied by her mother for the presence of two teeth since the child's birth. The mother complained that the teeth were making breastfeeding difficult, irritating the infant who could not manage to suck and then cries continuously. The medical history did not reveal any abnormalities and the patient did not use any medication at presentation.\nIntraoral examination revealed two natal teeth in the mandibular anterior region and an ulcerated lesion on the ventral surface of the tongue (). The lesion had a diameter of 8 mm and was located at the midline anterior portion of the ventral surface of the tongue and seemed to have the impression of the teeth on its center due to repetitive trauma resulting from raking movements of the tongue against the anterior natal teeth leading to the clinical diagnosis of Riga-Fede Disease.\nThe mother refused permission to perform radiographic examination and tongue biopsy of the child; thus it was not possible at the time to identify if the teeth were supernumerary or regular primary teeth and the histopathological diagnosis of the lesion was not executed.\nThe tooth located on the left side presented grade II mobility, with risk of displacement and consequent swallowing or aspiration, leading to the option of surgical removal (). The tooth on the right side with regular mobility was preserved. To prevent the repetition of the trauma on the tongue and to allow wound healing, a small increment of glass ionomer cement was added, covering the cutting edge of that tooth. After carrying out the procedures, the baby was put to breastfeed and the mother reported she was able to suck for a longer period, calming them both. The mother was also instructed to carry out hygiene of the child's tongue wound with saline solution.\nThe patient returned after five days showing a good healing of the lesion. After fifteen days, it was completely healed (). After one year of follow-up, clinical and radiographic control were performed (Figures and ). At the time it was confirmed that the natal teeth were regular primary teeth and there were no signs of recurrence of the lesion.\nThe patient's mother consented to the publication of the child's information along with her photographs and radiographs.","{

"This is unique case of a young 23 years old middle Eastern female who developed an acute unilateral eye pain and generalized headache with visual disturbances associated with fatigue and weakness in lower extremities for two days. She presented to a local community hospital and was examined by a neurologist. Physical examination revealed an exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and sustained clonus of extensor plantar responses. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. A spinal tap was performed in the neurologist office with a 22 gauge Quincke spinal needle between the third and fourth lumbar spaces after the first attempt with free flow of clear cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). This fluid was analyzed for IgG, albumin, and oligoclonal banding to confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was also obtained. All laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosis of MS. Patient returned home with follow-up appointment in 2 days. She later developed severe headache 10 hours after returning home. Headache was more localized to the back of the head and worsened with ambulation. Patient returned to the neurologist office the next day and was prescribed acetaminophen with bed rest. Nevertheless, she continued with severe headache on ambulation. In addition, she experienced dizziness and neck stiffness for the next 7 days. Follow-up evolutions and repeat physical examination revealed similar findings. Patient family remained concerned and decided to travel to the USA for additional treatment and consultation. She completed an 18 hours flight from her home town to the USA in a sitting position. At the completion of her journey, she experienced severe occipital and frontal headache associated with nausea/vomiting with neck stiffness and back pain. The pain intensity increased particularly during aircraft takeoff. Upon landing at airport, she had to be transported by a wheel chair to her car. She was seen the next day by another neurologist in the USA and after a complete examination was diagnosed with PDPH and repeated MRI of brain was completed at the same day (). She was prescribed complete bed rest, oral analgesics, caffeine 300 mg orally. She was seen again in 72 hours with similar complain of occipital headache worse on ambulation and was referred to a pain clinic for epidural blood patch. An appointment was scheduled for her with an anesthesiologist 4 weeks later after obtaining insurance coverage. An epidural blood patch was performed by withdrawing 20 mL of blood from the right antecubital vein under aseptic condition. At the same, the epidural space was identified between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrate space using the loss of resistance technique. Subsequently, 20 mL of blood was injected into the epidural space. She had an immediate relief of her headache and was able to ambulate to her car without difficulty.","{

"The patient was a 10 year-old boy with a height of 128 cm and a weight of 36 kg who complained of pain in the right lower abdomen. He was diagnosed with appendicitis, and it was decided to do an appendectomy. He had been diagnosed with grade 3 mental retardation at age 4 although an exact diagnosis was not possible because a DNA test was not done. However, the parents were planning for a second child and had a DNA test done in England when the patient was 10 and confirmed an 8p23 deletion. According to the past history, there were no abnormalities that accompanied the genetic disorder such as asthma, and DNA tests were done on the parents for a family history but all were normal. Based on the physical exam, the patient exhibited the characteristic facial features of microcephaly with a broad nasal bridge, short neck, and high arched palate. According to the airway examination, the interincisional distance was approximately 3 cm and the thyromental distance was approximately 5 cm when the mouth was opened at its widest maximum. The Mallampati airway classification was grade 3 and difficulty in intubation was predicted; there were no limitations in neck movement and there were no loose teeth but they were irregular. In an echocardiography conducted at another hospital, the patient had no heart problems that can accompany 50% of the people with deletion 8p23 syndrome, and there were no indication of Ebstein's malformation and TOF. No abnormalities were found in the blood tests or computed tomography (CT) done before surgery. The patient exhibited severe mental retardation and although simple communication was possible, he was not able to use language properly. The patient responded impulsively and showed destructive and aggressive behavior characteristic to this syndrome when moving to the operating bed such as pulling hair and kicking with his feet.\nBlood pressure before anesthesia was 125/70 mmHg; heart rate was 115 beats/min; oxygen saturation was at 100%, and the ECG was normal. In the emergency room before coming up to the operating room, a 22 G intravenous access was prepared on the right upper extremity but no medication before anesthesia was administered. As intubation was predicted to be difficult, a video glidescope was additionally prepared as well as a McCoy laryngoscope. Before proceeding with anesthesia, preoxygenation was done with 100% oxygen for several minutes. 50 µg of fentanyl and 150 mg of pentothal sodium was IV injected and mask ventilation was started with 4.0 vol% sevoflurane and 100% oxygen. After checking that the mask ventilation was operating properly, 30 mg rocuronium bromide was administered for rapid sequence intubation while Sellick's maneuver was done due to the risk of respiratory aspiration. After a minute, proper muscle relaxation was verified and the glottis were exposed using a Macintosh laryngoscope. Grade 3 in Cormack and Lehane airway classification was confirmed, and although intubation of an endotracheal tube with 6.5 mm envelope was attempted, it was unsuccessful so the video glidescope was used to carefully intubate an endotracheal tube with inserted stylet. Directly after intubation, blood pressure was 130/88 mmHg; heart rate was 100 beats/min, and oxygen saturation was at 100%. Mechanical ventilation was started with volume controlled ventilation with a 400 ml tidal volume and a respiratory rate of 15/min, while maintaining anesthesia with 50% oxygen/N2O and 1.0-2.0 vol% of sevoflurane. The operation lasted a total of 1 hour and 35 minutes and 200 ml of Ringer's lactate solution was supplied. There were no abnormalities during surgery and after the surgery had finished, 7.5 mg of pyridostigmine and 0.3 mg of glycopyrrolate was IV injected to contend with muscle relaxation. Spontaneous respiration was induced to confirm stable respiration. After confirming that the tidal volume was more than 5 ml/kg, the patient responded to the command to open his eyes, which indicated that he was awake. Then, extubation was done, followed by 100% oxygen through a mask while checking the recovery of consciousness and muscle motility. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to the recovery room. Respiration was regular in the recovery room but the patient displayed excessive behavior and impulsive responses shown before the anesthesia so 4 mg of nalbupine was IV injected and he was stabilized. Oxygen saturation and blood pressure were all normal.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Nausea and cloudy peritoneal dialysis effluent'], 'MedicalHistory': {'MedicalCondition': 'End stage renal disease due to chronic glomerulonephritis', 'Treatment': 'Automated peritoneal dialysis started in February 2015'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Peritoneal effluent analysis', 'Finding': 'White cell count of 996 cells/mL, with a polymorphonuclear cell fraction of 56%'}, {'Test': 'Peritoneal fluid culture', 'Finding': 'Coagulase-negative staphylococcus growth resistant to beta lactams but sensitive to vancomycin'}, {'Test': 'Serum vancomycin level monitoring', 'Finding': 'Vancomycin levels maintained above 25 mg/L throughout treatment'}, {'Test': 'Skin biopsy', 'Finding': 'Moderate mixed perivascular infiltrate with eosinophils, compatible with drug reaction'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome)', 'Type': 'Hypersensitivity reaction', 'Location': 'Generalized skin rash'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Oral prednisone therapy', 'Details': 'Started at 50 mg daily for 5 days'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Response to corticosteroid therapy', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '7 weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Received live donor kidney transplant'}}}"
"This is regarding a 54-year-old Hispanic male with no significant past medical or surgical history other than left-sided TN. He first developed this disease in 2019, and at that point was started on carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily. This worked reasonably well to control his neuralgic pain and he was able to continue doing his job until later part of 2020, when he started seeing his primary care physician more frequently. His symptoms gradually became more pronounced and frequent. He was now no longer able to work his usual job and had severe frequent intermittent episodes of left-sided facial pain. He subsequently had minimal oral intake and was barely able to sleep enough. By this time, his PCP had maximized his dose of carbamazepine but it failed to achieve any improvement. An outpatient trial of gabapentin, phenytoin, opioids, and NSAIDs had also been unsuccessful. In a span of 10 days, he had three ER visits before he was finally hospitalized with intractable pain and subsequent suicidal ideations. Family history of chiari malformation was reported in one of the siblings. His physical exam on initial presentation included normal vital signs. Neurological examination was pertinent with hyperalgesia reported along with the left lower V1 and throughout the entire left V2 cranial nerve distribution.\nMany therapeutic interventions were tried, including escalating doses of intravenous opioids, fosphenytoin loads and subcutaneous triptans but with minimal relief. He eventually required sedation with benzodiazepines to control pain and severe suicidal thoughts. After five days of different therapeutic interventions with no significant benefit, patient was transferred to a tertiary level care facility under the care of neurology and internal medicine. Upon arrival to the facility, a trial of ketamine infusion was attempted immediately but had to be stopped due to development of hallucinations. A trigeminal nerve block was attempted but gave minimal and transient relief only.\nIn the interim patient had multiple imaging studies conducted, including Brain MRI and CT angiogram none of which truly identified an etiology. Given refractoriness to medical interventions, neurosurgical team was approached. Patient eventually underwent left retro mastoid suboccipital craniectomy and intraoperatively the left superior cerebellar artery was found to adhere to the inferior ventral aspect of the left trigeminal root entry zone. Lysis of arachnoid adhesions was performed to separate this vessel and relocation to a more ventral lateral position, thereby achieving microvascular decompression. Postoperatively, patient was noted to have a dramatic improvement in his left-sided neuralgic pain and had discomfort over the surgical site only. He was monitored in the intensive care unit for about 24 hours and was discharged to home. A brief follow-up was done over the phone with the patient into four months following surgery. To this point, his symptoms have not recurred.","{

"A 21-month-old boy visited the hospital with a complaint of pain and redness at the right helix with an enlarged mass. A mass on the ear had existed from birth, and the size of the mass had recently shown a slight increase. The patient had no history of trauma, family history, or other associated abnormalities. On the physical examination, an obviously raised lump measuring approximately 2×2 cm in size was found at the upper part and back of the helix. The surface of skin on the mass appeared to be normal, except for a slight redness and skin findings of fistula or skin adhesions were not observed. Because this patient is a child, surgery was performed under general anesthesia with an incision parallel to the auricle and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mass at the back of helix. Because adhesion of helix cartilage to surrounding tissues was minimal, the skin covering the mass was raised easily. Helix cartilage on the mass was removed easily, however, an unusual depression was found on the helix cartilage. The mass was encapsulated; it was a cystic mass and cheese-like sebum was observed during dissection.\nHistological examination showed that the encapsulated film was composed of stratified squamous epithelium, and the inside of the cyst was composed of a keratinous cyst with laminated keratin material, however, adnexal structures of skin, such as hair and sweat glands, were not observed. Thus, it was diagnosed as an epidermoid cyst and invasion of acute and chronic inflammatory cells was observed around the mass. Skin suture was performed after excision of the mass, and no other procedure was required for treatment of depressed cartilage. Until three months after surgery, no complication such as inflammation was observed, however, at approximately one-year follow-up after surgery, two masses were observed at the top of the ipsilateral helix. The masses were removed and histologic examination showed the same result as that of the last year. Thus, the first mass was diagnosed as a congenital epidermoid cyst and the second was diagnosed as an acquired epidermoid cyst ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Request for breast re-implantation of the right side due to iatrogenic rupture'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousConditions': [{'Condition': 'Cancer in the right breast in 1984'}, {'Condition': 'Leiomyosarcoma in the right thigh and bilateral pulmonary metastases in 2015'}], 'Procedures': [{'Procedure': 'Unilateral mastectomy, radiochemotherapy, and secondary reconstruction with a subpectoral silicone implant'}, {'Procedure': 'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection of the right lung'}]}}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Defect of the thoracic wall and parietal pleura', 'Type': 'Iatrogenic complication', 'Location': 'Thoracic wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Breast re-implantation and closure of the parietal pleura defect using capsule tissue flap', 'Details': 'Creation of a pedicled flap using the anterior part of the capsule in relation to the pectoral muscle to cover the pleural defect and allow for secure re-implantation'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Discrete air effusion once chest tube suction was discontinued, 5.2 cm apical lung pneumothorax on day 5 post-op, regression to 3.1 cm at one-week follow-up', 'DischargeStatus': 'Fully functioning reconstruction at twelve-month follow-up with no symptoms'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Twelve months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Fully functioning with no symptoms reported'}}}"
"A 41-year-old man had been diagnosed as having a middle esophageal diverticulum based on an upper gastrointestinal contrast examination performed when he was 30 years old. He had not received treatment because he was asymptomatic. Eight months earlier, he experienced chest discomfort after eating and visited our hospital. His past history is pediatric asthma. The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position and four trocars inserted into the right thoracic cavity. A 12-mm trocar was inserted into the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. Only the left lung was ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest was created using CO2 gas at 6 mm. Twelve-mm trocars were inserted into the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle. A 5-mm trocar was then inserted into the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the ninth intercostal space at the level of the inferior scapular angle. The operator used the 12-mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the inferior scapular angle line and the 5 mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The assistant used the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The endoscope was inserted into the lumen of the upper thoracic esophagus before the patient was placed in the prone position and kept in the esophagus throughout the surgery. Confirmation of the middle esophageal diverticulum was easily achieved, but the area was difficult to exfoliate because the diverticular wall had adhered to the lymph nodes of the trachea bifurcation. To achieve a complete resection of the diverticulum, threads were placed on the oral and anal sides of the diverticulum, the threads were pulled. A thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line and the surgical stapler was inserted via the 12-mm port placed in the ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle, and the diverticulum was resected using two sets of the Tri-Stapler (Fig. ). A postoperative upper gastrointestinal contrast examination revealed no abnormalities (Fig. ). Oral intake was initiated on postoperative day 7, and he was discharged on postoperative day 12. The histopathological findings were a true diverticulum with a muscular layer and a highly inflamed mucosa. No malignant findings were seen (Fig. ). Postoperatively, the patient visited the hospital at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the surgery. He underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal contrast examination 1 year after the surgery. We found no evidence of recurrence of the esophageal diverticulum. We are planning to repeat the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 2 years after the surgery.","{

"A 62-year-old man attended his routine 1 year follow-up consultation following an uncomplicated UKR with a mobile bearing. During this appointment, the patient reported an uneventful initial recovery followed by an on-going pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of his knee, which started around 9 months after his surgery. He noted that the symptoms had evolved to a more constant background ache with consistent activity related pain alongside more stiffness over the last month.\nThe pain triggered his attendance to a community hospital on multiple occasions. The patient reported no specific history of trauma, but he remembers tripping while walking around the time of onset of recurrent symptoms. He complained of variable pain at the back of his knee which would ease, but never fully resolved. The main area of discomfort was around the medial hamstring tendons. At every attendance to the community hospital, he was assessed and reassured that this was most likely to be a hamstring strain and consequently, discharged with analgesia without any requirement of further investigation or discussion with our arthroplasty department.\nAt the 1 year follow-up appointment, radiographs (Fig. 4) were obtained which indicated that the polyethylene inserted was in fact dislocated posteriorly toward the popliteal fossa, into soft tissues adjacent to the neurovascular bundle, with consequent direct contact of metal components.\nClinical examination revealed a moderately swollen knee with a minimal effusion, with the affected limb noted to be in a greater varus alignment at the knee compared to the other leg. The range of motion was 10–125° with no noted major instability, and the varus was not fully correctable. There was moderate tenderness in the medial proximal tibia and distal femur as well as tenderness and focal swelling in the medial aspect of his popliteal fossa and medial hamstring tendon area.\nThe patient underwent a surgical exploration which revealed that both the femoral and tibial components were severely abraded, with consequent severe metallosis within the synovium. The polyethylene insert was encapsulated in thick fibrous tissue in the posterior soft tissues at the back of the knee which caused a difficult dissection close to the popliteal neurovascular structures. The initial incision had to be extended and UKR implants were removed, due to the degree of abrasive damage, to allow for a radical synovectomy and limited bone resection to remove the metallosis and for safe removal of the mobile bearing and its pseudocapsule. A total knee replacement (TKR) was undertaken with the patient mobilizing in a standard fashion, after which, they were discharged a 3 days later, without noted perioperative problem or complication. The patient went on to make a smooth recovery and was reviewed again at 1 and 5 years post-revision surgery.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Presented with gross hematuria in April 2016', 'Nocturia x4 and daytime frequency in September 2018'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastMedicalHistory': 'Adult onset type 2 diabetes, right inguinal hernia repair', 'Medications': 'Metformin', 'SocialHistory': 'Non-smoker, not overweight'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Transurethral resection pathology', 'Finding': 'Low grade Ta tumors in April 2016'}, {'Test': 'Surveillance cystoscopy', 'Finding': 'Negative findings'}, {'Test': 'Transurethral resection pathology', 'Finding': 'Four low grade Ta tumors in October 2016'}, {'Test': 'Transurethral resection pathology', 'Finding': 'High grade Ta urothelial cancer with focal carcinoma in situ in August 2018'}, {'Test': 'Flexible cystoscopy', 'Finding': 'Areas of necrosis consistent with previous treatment effects, areas of persistent or new high grade Ta tumor'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Negative findings'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Multifocal bladder cancer', 'Type': 'Urothelial cancer', 'Location': 'Bladder'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'TUR BT and possible bladder preservation approach with intravesical BCG', 'Details': 'Consideration of radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit or neobladder'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Pending treatment decision', 'DischargeStatus': 'N/A'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Dependent on treatment choice and patient preference'}}}"
"A 19-year-old male was referred to the Endodontic Department of Babol Dental College with the chief complaint of dental pain and sensitivity to cold in the anterior maxillary region. The patient appeared physically healthy, but mild mental retardation was obvious. In the medical history, he had childhood asthma which ameliorated by the age of seven. No history of trauma or hereditary involvement was reported. The patient showed a straight profile and a symmetric face without abnormal findings in extraoral examinations. Clinical intraoral examinations revealed permanent dentition with poor oral hygiene and multiple caries. The molar relationship was Angle class I in both sides. Maxillary and mandibular arcs were U-shaped with both midlines on (). In the anterior maxillary region, we came to the rare finding of twinning in both central incisors. Both centrals showed an abnormally large mesiodistal width. No lateral incisor existed in the right maxillary region. Instead, a mesiodistally large central existed with a dental projection on its palatal side extending from the cingulum and ending at a small groove in the incisor edge (Figures and ). At the left side of the anterior maxilla, both central and lateral incisors existed. The left maxillary incisor also showed a large mesiodistal width with a large groove on the palatal surface that extended up to the incisal edge (Figures and ). There was no tooth mobility and no tenderness to percussion and palpation tests. A severe response to cold and electric tests was observed in the anterior maxillary incisor teeth. History taking revealed that he has had a previous endodontic treatment of a maxillary premolar in the same department. Reference to his file showed that his mother had been advised to refer to restoring caries in other teeth. She had also been suggested to seal the palatal grooves of the left incisor and esthetic treatment in maxillary anterior region. Because of poor socioeconomic status, further treatment was delayed until pain occurred. A panoramic radiograph was prescribed to detect possible further anomalies and define the condition in the anterior maxillary region (). In the right maxillary, there were two crowns fused by dentin with one root and two canals. One tooth was missing in the right maxillary quadrant. In the left maxillary region, there was one bifid crown with one root and one root canal. No further anomaly was observed. No tooth was missing in the left maxillary quadrant. According to clinical and radiographic findings and tooth count in maxillary quadrants, dental fusion between right maxillary central and lateral incisor with a talon cusp and gemination in left maxillary central incisor were diagnosed.\nAccording to clinical and radiographic findings, caries initiating from the grooves around the talon cusp reached the pulp chamber, and irreversible pulpitis was diagnosed in the right maxillary fused incisors. Endodontic treatment of right incisors accompanied by composite esthetic restoration in both maxillary sides was suggested to the patient and his mother to alleviate pain and make a better appearance. As the patient preferred, our treatment was limited to endodontic treatment and restoration of painful teeth, right maxillary fused central and lateral incisors.\nLocal anesthesia containing 1.8 mL lidocaine and 1/80000 epinephrine (Daroo-Pakhsh Co., Iran) was injected in the labial sulcus and a rubber dam (Hu-friedy, USA) was inserted. Two Access cavities were prepared by a fissure bur number 0.8 (Tees-Karvan, Iran). Pulp tissue was extirpated by a barbed broach (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Working lengths of both canals were determined by K-File number 35 (Mani Inc., Japan) and a periapical radiograph. Canals were irrigated by 0.9% normal saline and sodium hypochlorite 2.5%. Cleaning and shaping was completed using a step back technique up to K-file number 80 and number 70 for the central and lateral incisor, respectively. As the patient was beginning to be uncomfortable and uncooperative, the canals were dried by sterile papers, calcium hydroxide was placed in root canals, the access cavities were temporized with cavit (Golchay Co., Iran), and the patient was dismissed. After one week, the patient returned for obturation. No pain or sensitivity during the week was reported. The canals were obturated by thermoplastic vertical condensation technique using gutta percha cones (Meta Biomed Co., Korea) and AH26 (Dentsply, USA) as a sealer (). Access cavities were restored by universal light cure composite resin (3 M, ESPE) (). The patient was asymptomatic in the six-month followup.","{

"A three year old boy with two weeks history of right facial nerve paralysis, gait disturbance and difficulty swallowing, presented in an unconscious condition. CT scan revealed a well defined lesion with area of calcification in the right cerebellum []. There was a right to left shift of the fourth ventricle and severe obstructive hydrocephalus. After a shunting procedure the patient regained full consciousness. Further neurological examination revealed paralysis of right facial nerve, right sided dysmetria and dysdiadokokinesia neck stiffness and nystagmus. Deep reflexes were increased bilaterally. There was no papilledema. There were no cutaneous lesions or significant family history suggesting the diagnosis. A diagnosis of right cerebellar tumor was made and surgical removal was performed three days following shunting procedure.\nRight sub occipital craniotomy was performed. After retracting normal cerebellar tissue, we observed widened and well preserved cerebellar folia with a consistency comparable to a glioma. The tumor tissue was pale gray and poorly vascularized. As we went deeper, the border between tumor and normal cerebellar tissue was clearly distinguished. Further surgical exploration revealed that the lesion involved only the cerebellar folia; there was no infiltration of the medulla, pons and cranial nerves. Gross total tumor removal was achieved in this case.\nThe patient made uneventful recovery. Facial nerve paralysis remained but swallowing difficulties were reduced. On discharge, the patient was able to walk although a little unstable and had no difficulty swallowing. Over the following six month period there was complete resolution of all neurological deficits except for very mild paralysis of the right facial nerve. Control MRI three months after surgery at a private hospital revealed total tumor removal and the brain stem has resumed almost normal size and position [Figure and ].\nSection of the tumor mass revealed relatively well preservation of the cerebellar architecture with widened and distorted folia []. There was diffuse enlargement of the molecular and internal granular layers, which were filled with dispersed of ganglionic cells of varying sizes []. Purkinje cells were absent throughout the entire specimen. On the basis of this pathological report, the patient was diagnosed as LDD.

"This patient was a male in his early sixties. He was admitted to an integrative ward of a University Hospital, with a progressing two-vessel coronary heart disease. The patient was scheduled for bypass surgery. The medical history of the patient comprised a Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent implantation had been conducted in the past.\nIn a short interview preceding the LAVA assessment the patient reported that he had noticed a worsening of his coronary disease under physical exertion in his daily life before hospitalization. Nevertheless, the extent of deterioration that was diagnosed during his hospitalization, surprised him and he described an uncertainty because he did not know what might have caused the worsening of his disease nor how to positively influence the progression of the disease (e.g., life style modifications).\nFigure shows the LAVA self-assessment of the patient.\nWhen using the LAVA-Tool the patient rated eight terms as very important for his life. The three topics the patient was most dissatisfied with were mobility, contact to nature, and the ability to make decisions independently. The negative rating of mobility and contact with nature were probably influenced by the patient’s current situation in the hospital and by his disease. However, his dissatisfaction with his ability to make decisions independently could be attributed to his lack of knowledge concerning his disease and the expected improvement of his condition and mobility after the bypass surgery. A patient consultation that focused on a shared decision and understanding of the link between the treatment aims and his current negative experiences in life could therefore be helpful.\nFor this patient, the application of the LAVA tool led to the conclusion that the patient had a need for information. In this case, more information about the disease and the planned surgical intervention could probably help the patient to reduce his uncertainty and to feel more empowered to actively participate in his treatment. In the preceding interview the importance of the information need was not fully captured by the interviewer. The LAVA tool – forcing the patient to weigh his satisfaction with important aspects in his life – made it easier to capture his priorities, thereby showing a potential to improve his situation with a simple measure (i.e. patient information). One could argue that more information and a better understanding of the planned intervention would not have changed the somatic state of the patient. However, and most importantly, for patients with multiple conditions an improvement in well-being and a reduction of fear and uncertainty could make an important difference to their quality of life.","{

"A 60-year-old man presented with a 16×6 cm2 open wound with an accompanying tibiofibular fracture due to a traffic accident. Free flap coverage was planned, with a necessary pedicle length of 14 cm from the middle of the flap to the recipient vessel and 9 cm from the flap margin. A 20×6 cm2 ALT flap from the patient’s ipsilateral thigh was planned. The perforator that branched at the proximal descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery was found intraoperatively (). The length of the branched perforator was 7 cm, and the available length of the descending branch on the proximal side was 2 cm, so the estimated pedicle length was 9 cm (). For pedicle length extension, dissection was performed on the distal aspect, which resulted in obtaining 7 cm of the distal descending branch. Thus, we were able to obtain a reverse ALT free flap with a total pedicle length of 14 cm in the distal direction. Before elevating the reverse ALT free flap, we clamped the proximal descending branch to check for flap circulation. We confirmed that flap congestion was present due to impaired retrograde flow through the valves of the vena comitans in the distal direction. To resolve flap congestion, one of the venae comitantes of the distal descending branch was isolated and connected to the proximal venous stump in an antegrade manner (). When connecting a 1.5-mm vena comitans of the distal descending branch with the 2-mm proximal venous stump, the diameter discrepancy of the venous anastomosis was not significant (). A modified ALT flap pedicle 15 cm in length was formed to prevent venous congestion and to ensure adequate length to reach the recipient vessel. As a result, the direction of the arterial flow to the flap was retrograde, and the venous flow was antegrade. To evaluate the flap condition after surgery, the flap color was checked and the pin-prick test and Doppler ultrasonography were performed. For 2 days after surgery, the flap status was maintained, with no findings of congestion or insufficiency. Examinations during the 3-month follow-up revealed that the flap was maintained without complications.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Painless intra-oral growth since one and half years', 'Difficulty in closing mouth and chewing food'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No relevant information'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Physical Examination', 'Finding': 'Smooth surfaced, lobulated growth of 5 × 4 × 2 cm on alveolar ridge'}, {'Test': 'Radiographical Examination', 'Finding': 'Biconcave resorption of alveolar ridge and small root piece in mandibular posterior region'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Pyogenic granuloma', 'Type': 'Benign growth', 'Location': 'Right mandibular alveolar region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Excisional biopsy', 'Details': 'Removal of growth under local anesthesia'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Suture removal after 7 days', 'DischargeStatus': 'No signs of recurrence'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1 year', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Under regular follow-up'}}}"
"A 30-year-old Indian man was brought to our Emergency Room after a road traffic accident, in which he was riding a motorcycle and was hit by a truck at a speed of approximately 50 miles per hour. Our patient complained of pain in his right arm and the inability to move it. An examination of his extremities revealed contusions over his right upper arm without any evidence of penetrating injury. There was marked swelling and tenderness in the middle part of his right arm associated with a closed injury. His cranial nerves were intact and no neurological deficits were present. No injures were found in his other limbs. In view of the above clinical findings, a radiograph of his right upper limb and a computed tomography (CT) scan of his head were suggested. While the CT scan did not reveal any abnormality, the radiograph of his right arm showed a unilateral displaced comminuted fracture of the mid shaft of his humerus (Figure ). Our patient was then given first aid in the form of a U-slab and immediately transferred to our orthopedic ward for further evaluation. His laboratory results were normal. Liver and kidney function test values were within their normal range. An electrocardiogram did not show any abnormal features.\nOur patient complained of tingling and numbness in his right little and ring fingers the following morning. On examination, there was hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints with an inability to move his little and ring finger (Figure ). With the suspicion of an ulnar nerve injury due to the accident, a series of nerve conduction studies of his right upper arm nerves were suggested. The electrodiagnostic evaluation demonstrated a severe ulnar nerve conduction block along his arm with normal amplitudes of conduction along the median and the radial nerves.\nCorrelating the clinical findings with the above radiological and nerve conduction findings, a diagnosis of ulnar nerve injury after the fracture of the shaft of the humerus was made. Our patient was taken to the Operating Room for surgery, during which a fragment of bone was found abutting the ulnar nerve after penetrating the triceps muscle (Figure A,B). This fragment of bone was replaced and the fracture was reduced by open reduction and internal fixation using a dynamic compression plate and screws.\nPostoperatively, the tingling and numbness of the little and ring finger gradually subsided and our patient received regular physiotherapy and was discharged two weeks after surgery. Our patient was advised to come regularly for follow-up every three months for a period of one year. Our patient first came for a follow-up appointment four months after discharge and told the attending surgeon about the recovery of the normal functioning of his right hand 14 weeks after surgery; confirming it to have been ulnar neuropraxia.","{

"An 11-year-old boy visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of persistent right cheek pain. His family history revealed that his father had severe hearing impairment. His medical history showed that he had allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis that had been treated until 3 months previously by an otolaryngologist.\nThe patient initially visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling 6 weeks previously. A checkup at a dental clinic performed on the day before this initial visit revealed no abnormal findings. He showed clinical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal infection showed positive results. The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal infection. Facial cellulitis was also suspected and treatment with amoxicillin helped improve symptoms. However, facial pain recurred within 4 weeks of the initial visit. The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN. Subsequently, oral clarithromycin administration was initiated for sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. However, administration of clarithromycin for 1 week was not effective for his facial pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no neurovascular compression ( right), which ruled out idiopathic, classical TN. During this time, we interviewed the patient on the nature of the right cheek pain. The patient described the pain as persistent, nagging, and dull in nature, which was completely different from the characteristics of pain associated with TN. Furthermore, trigger maneuvers failed to evoke pain. These evaluations excluded TN, and, thus, PIFP was diagnosed in week 2. Low dose of oral anticonvulsant carbamazepine (50 mg, twice a day) was initiated but was ceased due to general fatigue after the first administration.\nAlthough the patient had been previously cheerful and greeted us when entering the examination room, he became gradually emotionless with headache and nausea in week 5. In addition, feeding difficulties and numbness in the arms occurred. An orthostatic tolerance test revealed no positive findings for orthostatic dysregulation. It became difficult for the patient to attend school in week 6. Because various somatic symptoms developed in addition to PIFP, psychological factors were suspected to be pertinent in the etiology of PIFP. During a detailed medical interview with the patient and his mother, several problems were revealed: the patient loved swimming but his swimming record had plateaued after fixing his swimming form even though he practiced vigorously at a top-class swimming club team. Moreover, because of a recent finger injury, he could not practice as intensely as he wanted; therefore, his competitive ability as a swimmer deteriorated. Furthermore, in early adolescence, the patient had difficulties in communication and his relationship with his father was strained due to the father's hearing impairment. Because these suggested that the circumstances surrounding him might have led to somatoform disorders, psychological counseling was ordered in week 6.\nAs the patient faced, understood, and tolerated his psychological stress through counseling and psychotherapy twice a week, he gradually became expressive, worked up his appetite, and could attend school in week 10. Although sinusitis recurred at week 29, no facial pain developed. The patient received psychological counseling twice or thrice a month by this time. After 8 months, the frequency of counseling was reduced to once in 2 months. During this period, the patient's voice changed and became deeper at puberty. After confirming that facial pain as well as general malaise did not occur, even when the patient experienced distressing events, such as terminal examinations, counseling was ceased after 1 year and 8 months. After 3 years, the patient went on to high school and currently attends school cheerfully without any complaints and has resumed swimming.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Painless swelling on the hypothenar eminence of the left hand'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Arterial duplex', 'Finding': 'Confirmed an aneurysmal sac'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Ulnar artery aneurysm', 'Type': 'Vascular', 'Location': 'Hypothenar eminence of the left hand'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical excision and repair with reverse cephalic vein graft', 'Details': 'Excision of aneurysmal swelling involving the ulnar artery and repair with a reverse cephalic vein graft'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Palpable pulses in both ulnar and radial arteries, intact motor movement', 'DischargeStatus': 'No anticoagulation required'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'No further follow-up studies conducted', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Intact motor movement post-surgery'}}}"
"A 55-year-old woman was seen at the outpatient clinic in 2007 because of progressive complaints of angina. Her medical history included hypertension and a cardiac murmur, which had already been diagnosed during a medical examination when she was 18 years old. In 1991, she was evaluated because of symptoms of dizziness and near collapse during exertion. Besides systolic hypertension, no structural heart disease was found except for a mild aortic regurgitation and a peak systolic pressure gradient of 17 mmHg (heart rate 68 beats/min) over the aortic valve. She was treated with antihypertensive drugs and visited her cardiologist on a regular, yearly basis. Because of therapy refractory hypertension she was also referred to the internist to exclude underlying causes of her hypertension, but no underlying cause was diagnosed. When she was 50 years old, she stopped smoking because mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was diagnosed. At that time echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy (septum en posterior wall diameter both 12 mm) with normal systolic function, still a mild aortic regurgitation and a peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve of 28 mmHg (heart rate 64 beats/min). In the meantime, she was treated with four different antihypertensive drugs, but she remained hypertensive. To evaluate her complaints of angina in 2007 a nuclear exercise stress test was performed, which showed signs of reversible perfusion defects in the inferior, posterior and lateral walls suggestive of myocardial ischaemia. During following cardiac catheterisation, via the right femoral artery, the catheter could not be advanced up the ascending aorta because of a discrete narrowing of the aorta (Fig. ). Catheterisation performed via the radial artery showed a significant stenosis in the circumflex artery which was subsequently dilated and stented. The calculated peak pressure gradient across the narrowed thoracic aorta was 30 mmHg. Additional computed tomography (CT) scan of the aorta confirmed the diagnosis of coarctation with a pinpoint stenosis in the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. Moreover, an extensive collateral network, mainly consisting of bronchial and lumbar arteries, was seen (Fig. ). Atherosclerotic changes in the cerebral vasculature were excluded by a digital subtraction angiography. It was decided by our congenital team to accomplish an extra-anatomical bypass 1 year after coronary stenting (Fig. ). Via a posterolateral thoracotomy an extra-anatomical bypass was constructed between the aortic isthmus and descending aorta by the use of a 16-mm prosthetic graft. No perioperative complications occurred and postoperatively, for the first time in her life, her blood pressure was better under control with antihypertensive drugs even with dose reduction of the medication. After more than 2 years of follow-up she was still free of angina, experienced a better exercise tolerance and her blood pressure levels were under control.","{

"A 77-year-old female presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a three-year history of an extremely sensitive small mass on her right wrist. The mass had subjectively grown over this period of time. The pain had progressively worsened over time, and she had developed significant hypersensitivity to light contact. There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel’s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. At her first postoperative visit, she reported no pain and that she was very satisfied with the results of her surgery. Diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin (Figures , ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe head trauma after falling from a roof', 'Previously hospitalized in ICU for 8 days with resolved cerebral oedema'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT Scan', 'Finding': '12 cm by 12 cm defect in cranial vault'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)', 'Type': 'Head injury', 'Location': 'Cranial vault'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Cranial Reconstruction', 'Details': 'Decompressive craniotomy followed by 3D PMMA prosthesis placement'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No sequelae or neurologic damage', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient returned to school with headache relief'}}}"
"43year old male presented to the Emergency Department with a day old history of acute left upper abdominal pain; nausea and vomiting for 2 days with some associated dizziness and anorexia. The patient underwent an emergency contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis which showed an markedly abnormal spleen, inhomogeneous and enlarged, approximately 20 × 11 cm with fluid in the inferior aspect of the mesenteric fat, with free fluid in the abdomen and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.\nThe patient was volume resuscitated following admission to the hospital, and his Hct was serially followed. Since there was no history of trauma and the CT did not look like a traumatic splenic laceration the oncology service was contacted who felt that the findings were most compatible with lymphoma and because there was some bleeding going on did not recommend trying to treat it without a tissue diagnosis.\nThe patient underwent a splenectomy. He was found to have a massively enlarged spleen with areas where it appeared to be tumor extruding through the splenic capsule. There was a lot of ecchymotic tissue inferior to where the spleen had been and there was slight oozing which was controlled as much as possible as the area was quite friable. The tail of the pancreas was identified and left alone as there was no bleeding. The estimated blood loss was approx 2 L.\nFollowing extubation the patient had some issues with agitation which was attributable to ETOH withdrawal. The patient had a history of 6pack qd ETOH abuse. He was placed on CIWA protocol. His mental status remained at the level of agitation and confusion for the next 4 days not helped by serax or ativan or haldol. Psychiatry consult was given and they felt the agitation was secondary to post op delirium vs. paradoxical ativan reaction. At that point it was thought that the agitation and delirium was secondary to possible 'pain vs. sepsis.' He was started on cefazolin 1 gm q8 hrs post op which was changed to meropenem 1 gm q 12 hr on POD#4.\nIn the post operative period the patient's Hct remained stable on serial examination. however his Bilirubin continually rose and peaked at 10.5 on post op day # 3. Other LFT s were mildly elevated. Gastroenterology team was consulted who felt that the increase bilirubin was secondary to sepsis. Differential diagnosis of hemolysis was considered but was thought unlikely as the Hct remained stable. Biliary obstruction was unlikely given his LFT s were only mildly elevated. A hepatitis panel was run and the patient was found to be positive for Hepatitis C. Anesthesia related rise in bilirubin was also considered but again AST and ALT were mildly elevated.\nThe patient was discharged home on post op day #9 on PO Moxifloxacin 400 mg q d for 5 days to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics. His liver function test lab values were almost near normal on discharge.","{

"A 51-year-old man reported with complaints of recent onset of left knee pain. He had sustained a displaced comminuted fracture of his left patella following a fall 15 months ago. Modified tension band wiring with cerclage wiring was successfully performed, and the patient was recovering well. He was well for the last 14 months and returned to his job without any pain or functional disability. However, he started experiencing deep-seated pain within the left knee with restriction of movements for the last 4 weeks. There was no recent history of any fall or trauma to the left knee. Clinical examination of the left knee revealed no patella or joint line tenderness but pieces of wires were palpable percutaneously. There was no effusion and the cruciate and collateral ligaments were intact; there was no neurovascular deficit. There was no extensor lag and knee extension power was normal. The range of motion of the knee was painfully restricted.\nRadiographs of the left knee revealed a united fracture patella with broken cerclage wire (). The inferio-medial segment of the broken cerclage wire was found to have migrated into the posterior compartment of the knee joint and hooked anteriorly at the base of anterior cruciate ligament.\nThe patient underwent surgery for removal of the patella wires. Fluoroscopic examination before surgery revealed the posterior part of wire had shifted its position with anterior part of it still hooked with anterior cruciate ligament. An arthroscopic examination of the knee was done through the standard anteromedial and anterolateral portal. Any structural damage including chondral lesion due to wire migration was not found, a migrated piece of wire was found embedded at the base of anterior cruciate ligament, going toward posterior compartment of knee through medial side of notch, which was removed (). We used intraoperative fluoroscopy (), before finishing the arthroscopic examination of knee, which demonstrated that, there was no remaining piece of wire in posterior compartment of knee. The rest of the broken wires were removed via a midline anterior knee incision along the old scar. The patella was stable after complete removal of the wires, indicating union of the rest of the fragments.\nThe patient was discharged the next morning and his wounds healed at 2 weeks. Complaints of knee pain resolved completely following the surgery, and the patient was able to resume work at 2 weeks.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for 1 month'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Emergency exploratory laparotomy with omental patch repair for peptic perforation'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm × 7 cm'}, {'Test': 'Upper GI Endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Benign ulcer at the pylorus of the stomach'}, {'Test': 'CT Fistulogram', 'Finding': 'Enterocutaneous fistula between pylorus of stomach and anterior abdominal wall'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Complex gastrocutaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Gastrointestinal condition', 'Location': 'Pylorus of stomach and anterior abdominal wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Exploratory laparotomy with omental patch repair, feeding jejunostomy, retrograde tube duodenostomy', 'Details': 'Drainage of abscess cavity, repair of pyloric perforation, adhesiolysis, dissection'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '4 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient had incisional hernia but was otherwise doing fine'}}}"

"A 32-year-old white man presented to a local emergency department with a noticeable puncture wound, progressive swelling, and erythema to the right leg. The injury was sustained when he fell against the metal pedal of his bicycle. After 3 days of hospitalization and multiple courses of antibiotic, a surgical team was consulted for operative debridement of the wound. Diagnosis and confirmation of necrotizing fasciitis by polymicrobial group A streptococcal organisms was made. The resultant surgical debridement of the right posterior leg over the span of 1 week resulted in an open wound extending from the right popliteal fossa to about 8 cm from his right ankle (). After a period of negative pressure wound therapy, the patient was referred to University of California Davis Medical Center for definitive reconstruction of his posterior right leg wound with exposed Achilles tendon. The patient had a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently in remission, and ureteral stone causing hydronephrosis. He had no history of diabetes, alcoholism, or other general medical condition. The patient was a habitual smoker with history of drug abuse. Upon transfer to University of California Davis medical center, he was immediately prepared for free-tissue transfer.\nA line was drawn from anterior superior iliac spine to the lateral border of the patella (). This line roughly corresponds to the intermuscular septum between the rectus femoris and the vastus lateralis muscles. Skin vessels supplying the ALT flap are centered along this line or slightly lateral of it. The midpoint of this line, an area where skin perforators are generally located, was marked. Additional perforators were located within 10 cm proximal and distal to the midpoint perforator. At each location, this conventional naming system of skin perforator clusters provides a guideline for vascular localization. A handheld Doppler was used to localize the skin perforators in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The required size of the ALT flap was then measured and marked incorporating these perforators.\nExamination of the foot revealed palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels and a normal modified lower-extremity Allen's test. After debridement of the open wound, the right posterior tibial vessels were exposed for use as recipient vessels. A large free ALT flap with a 15 × 20 cm2 skin paddle based on 2 perforators was harvested from the right thigh for coverage of the right Achilles tendon. No thinning of the flap was performed. Of note, the flap pedicle was medial and pierced through the medial aspect of the rectus muscle, slightly increasing dissection time. Once the flap was raised, the pedicle was divided at the bifurcation from the profunda femoral artery and was anastomosed to the posterior tibial vessels using a surgical microscope without complication. Vein couplers were used for venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis was performed with interrupted 9.0 Nylon suture in an end-to-end fashion. The flap was inset to completely cover the Achilles tendon. The remaining exposed gastrocnemius muscle was covered with STSG from the right thigh and vacuum-assisted closure therapy (KCI, San Antonio, Texas) was initiated (). The foot perfusion was examined by normal capillary refill in all toes and palpable dorsalis pedis artery.\nThe patient was placed in an intensive care unit for Cook Doppler monitoring for 4 days postoperatively and on a splint to keep his foot at 90 degrees. The Cook Dopplers and vacuum-assisted closure device were removed on postoperative day (POD) 5, and the patient was discharged home on POD 7 (). Although the patient was scheduled for immediate physical therapy to improve foot function, he did not begin therapy until 4 to 5 weeks after discharge due to financial difficulties. Despite the late start, the patient was able to gain independent ambulation by 8 weeks postoperatively ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Patient presented with right foot pain and fever'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastMedicalHistory': 'Diabetes mellitus'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Physical Examination', 'Finding': 'Arterial occlusion in the right lower extremity involving the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery, and peroneal artery'}, {'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Presence of a tibial IM nail'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Complication of diabetes - ASO', 'Type': 'Complication', 'Location': 'Right lower extremity'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Below-knee amputation', 'Details': 'Surgical removal of the amputated limb and IM nail at the same time'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient is to be monitored for any complications'}}}"
"A 19-year-old male patient reported to the department of conservative dentistry and endodontics following trauma to the maxillary anterior region due to a road accident around 20 days back. He complained of fractured maxillary incisors and presented a desire to get them restored in order to have an aesthetic smile. Clinical examination of the patient revealed complicated crown fracture of the upper incisors. An intraoral swelling with a sinus tract was present on the labial gingiva between upper right central and lateral incisor (Figures and ). A radiograph of the maxillary anterior region illustrated horizontal root fracture at the middle third of the upper right central and lateral incisors () but clinically no mobility of the coronal fragment was evident. On the other hand the roots of the upper left central and lateral incisors were intact and endodontic treatment had been done for the upper left central and lateral incisors ().\nAfter explaining the treatment plan to the patient and obtaining his consent, endodontic treatment with the upper right central and lateral incisors was initiated. The working length was correctly determined and canals were cleaned, shaped using K files in a step-back manner to an apical file size #60. The remainder of the canals were shaped to obtain a uniform taper from apex towards coronal. An interappointment calcium hydroxide dressing was given and the patient was recalled after 7 days.\nOn the second visit, when the swelling had resolved, root canals were sectionally obturated with gutta percha cone and AH plus sealer. A gutta percha cone of the same size of the prepared root canal (size #60, with a taper of 2%) was selected and tried into the canal to obtain a snug fit. It was then cut to obtain a section which would be 2-3 mm short of the apical fragment of the root. A suitable plugger which loosely fits 2-3 mm short of the apical root fragment was selected and a stopper was set at this length. The sectioned gutta percha was then coated with AH plus sealer. One end of gutta percha was mounted to a heated plugger and then carried into the canal to the desired length. After this, gutta percha was disengaged from the plugger by slightly rotating the plugger in anticlockwise direction ().\nAfter 5 days of recall, the tooth was asymptomatic and the sinus tract healed. Next, glass fiber posts were used to retain the fractured root fragments. Appropriate glass fiber posts were tried into the canals, adjusted to the desired length until they just passively touched the apical gutta percha. Root canals were etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel and dried with paper points. The fiber posts were luted with dual cure resin cement, inserted into the canal without applying any pressure, and then light cured for 40 seconds. The benefit of higher viscosity of the cement in absence of pressure is that it reduces the flow of the resin. Also, the resin was used cautiously only in the amount necessary to achieve a desirable bond between the post and the dentin. Only the post was luted with the cement. Coating the root canal walls with resin cement was precluded to prevent the flow of excess cement laterally between the root fragments.\nThese fiber posts served as an intraradicular splint, stabilizing the fractured fragments in position. Glass fiber-reinforced posts were used as they exhibit high fatigue strength and high tensile strength and have a modulus of elasticity closer to dentin. Composite cores were built over the posts (). The other two incisors (maxillary left central and lateral incisors) received a similar post and core treatment (Figures –). The teeth were then restored with full-coverage porcelain fused to metal crowns (Figures –).\nThe patient was reevaluated on a regular basis. After 12 months of recall, the patient presented with aesthetically pleasing results and sound periodontium and the fractured root fragments were well retained with the aid of a post (Figures and ).","{

"Case 2: A 23 year old male, presented with symptoms of crawling sensation and foreign body sensation in his right eye, and had observed a worm in this eye. He had no previous symptoms prior to his presentation. He gave a history of having worked in a cocoa farm plantation during his childhood years and had severally suffered from bites from unknown flies. He had no systemic symptoms nor signs and aside from his ocular complains was healthy. There was no swelling anywhere in the body and no itching. Upon ocular examination his visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. The only significant finding was the presence of an actively mobile worm in the nasal subconjunctival space of the right eye """". This worm soon migrated upwards towards the superior fornix and away from view during the examination and before removal could be attempted """". The patient was immediately asked to adopt a face down position and within 30minutes of this time; he could feel a crawling sensation again in the same eye indicating that the worm was back. He was quickly taken to the operating room and the worm was extracted successfully using a local infiltration of the conjunctiva with lignocaine anesthesia. Histological examination revealed it to be an adult Loa loa worm.\nCases 3: A 25 year old female who had suffered sensation of movement and foreign body sensation in both eyes for the past 10 years and gave a past history of swimming in rural streams during childhood years. There was no history of swelling on the body and no itching. She had noticed an increasingly frequent occurrence of a worm like movement in both eyes over these years. Following ingestion of diethyl carbamazepine she noticed a sudden appearance of a red patch in the right eye. Upon examination her visual acuity was 6/5 in both eyes. The only significant finding was a localized hyperemic raised lesion on the surface of the right eye. This turned out to be a subconjuctival worm in the inferotemporal subconjunctival space of the right eye. The worm was found to be lifeless and covered by a surrounding cyst wall """". Care was taken to dissect the conjunctival and subtenons tissue away from the encysted worm, which was carefully extracted with a toothless forceps. Conjunctival incision site was closed with interrupted sutures. Histology revealed an adult Loa loa worm.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Discharging sinus in the epigastrium'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousSurgeries': [{'Procedure': 'Mechanical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis', 'Year': '14 years ago'}, {'Procedure': 'Repeat mechanical aortic valve replacement for streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis', 'Year': '12 years ago'}]}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Exploration of the sinus', 'Finding': 'In communication with anterior mediastinum, staphylococcus aureus infection'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Encapsulated mass extending from ascending aorta to diaphragm, cutaneous fistulization to epigastrium'}, {'Test': 'MR scan', 'Finding': 'Longitudinal retrosternal mass extending from mid ascending aorta to diaphragm'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Encapsulated retrosternal mass with cutaneous fistulization', 'Type': 'Infection', 'Location': 'Anterior mediastinum, epigastrium'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Exploratory secondary median sternotomy, excision of the mass, omentum transposition', 'Details': 'Removal of mass and communication tracts, excision of involved tissues, omentum transposition for wound closure'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Satisfactory', 'DischargeStatus': 'Home discharge after 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Fit and well'}}}"
"A 6-year-old male child presented to the emergency department with a history of orchiopexy done elsewhere for a right undescended testis palpable in the superficial inguinal pouch. While performing the orchiopexy, the surgeon had inadvertently injured the right femoral artery by electrocautery. The artery was repaired, but as he failed to palpate a good distal pulse, the patient was referred to us at a tertiary hospital which is about 300 km away. The patient was transported by road and reported to us about 12 h after the injury. On examination of the referral notes, it was found that a peripheral computed tomography angiography of the lower extremity with aortography was performed immediately after the repair of the femoral artery at the primary institute, which suggested abrupt cutoff of the right femoral artery near the origin of the profunda femoris artery. At presentation, the distal pulses were absent in the right lower limb, and the limb was pale and cold. The patient had a sutured wound over the right upper thigh starting from the pubic bone medially and extending laterally along the skin crease between the thigh and abdomen up to a point lying about 5 cm below the anterior superior iliac spine []. After clinical examination at our institute, Doppler study of the lower limbs was performed to know the extent of the thrombosis, which showed a thrombus extending from the femoral up to the external iliac artery above the inguinal ligament proximally. Immediate reexploration was planned in view of pale and cold peripheries of the affected leg and no distal flow on Doppler. On exploration of the wound, it was found that orchiopexy was not completed by the previous surgeon and the testis was seen lying in the superficial inguinal pouch at the superior flap of the wound. At the middle of the wound, the sutured, contracted femoral artery was seen []. A longitudinal extension of the incision was made along the long axis of the limb for better exposure of the femoral artery. Systemic heparinization was performed, the artery was isolated, and control was taken with vascular loops, both proximally and distally. The arterial sutures were removed and an intraluminal clot was removed. The lumen was thoroughly irrigated with heparinized saline. A Fogarty balloon thrombectomy was performed proximally and distally. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on lay graft was applied over the defect []. The wounds were closed after completing orchiopexy. The patient had a good distal flow on the table. Postoperatively, the patient was continued with low–molecular-weight heparin for 5 days and antiplatelet therapy for 3 months. Doppler study at 3 months showed good caliber and flow in the femoral artery. He is asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up.","{

"A 77-year-old female presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a three-year history of an extremely sensitive small mass on her right wrist. The mass had subjectively grown over this period of time. The pain had progressively worsened over time, and she had developed significant hypersensitivity to light contact. There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel’s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. At her first postoperative visit, she reported no pain and that she was very satisfied with the results of her surgery. Diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin (Figures , ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['History of exstrophy of the bladder repair 17 years ago', 'Continuous leakage of urine from lower abdominal wall', 'Irregular mass arising from exposed bladder mucosa rapidly increasing in size'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Dehiscence of repair and continuous urine leakage following exstrophy repair, ileal conduit urinary diversion 6 months prior'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Mildly enhancing nodular lesion on right side of lower abdomen superficially confined to urinary bladder'}, {'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Squamous cell carcinoma'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Lower abdomen, urinary bladder'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection', 'Details': 'Removal of urinary bladder and cuff of surrounding abdominal wall, peritoneum mobilization, recti mobilization, extended groin flap from left side for resurfacing'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful with small collection beneath flap requiring drainage and daily dressings', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '5 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No evidence of recurrence'}}}"
"A 59-year-old female initially presented to the emergency department 10 months prior with right arm pain and swelling. A computed tomography of the neck with contrast at the time showed two confluent masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions encasing the right subclavian and axillary vein, the internal mammary artery, and narrowing of the lower internal jugular vein. Patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient was evaluated by the oncology and radiation oncology services and underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Her course of chemotherapy was complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. Gradually, her pain of the right upper extremity worsened, and the patient was started on opioid therapy. Despite titration of her oral medications to extended release morphine 90 mg two times a day, immediate release morphine 30 mg every 2 to 3 hours, methadone 5 mg daily, and gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, her pain control remained suboptimal. She was referred to our pain clinic for further management of her intractable pain.\nOn presentation, the patient reported a constant 10/10 pain on the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) of the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. The pain was reported as dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature. Her pain was worsened by passive and active range of motion, and the pain at its best was a 7/10 with oral medications. Patient also reported progressive weakness of the entire right upper extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus was obtained, and the study revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus at the level of the divisions and cords as well as the right brachial artery ().\nDiagnostic brachial plexus block was performed in the hospital due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain. The brachial plexus was unable to be visualized using ultrasonography in the classic supraclavicular area due to the tumor effect, thus the block was performed at the level of the trunks using a lower interscalene approach. 18 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected under direct ultrasound guidance. The patient reported complete pain relief lasting approximately 12 hours after the nerve block. Given the success of the diagnostic nerve block, the patient was offered the option of chemical neurolytic brachial plexus block with an extensive discussion of the unique risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient elected to proceed to a right brachial plexus nerve block with dehydrated ethanol.","{

"A 46 years old housewife presented with left knee pain of ten months’ duration without significant trauma. She had been treated elsewhere as septic arthritis of the left knee based on the radiological features of severe bone defect of the medical condyle of the left tibia. There was neither history nor clinical appearance suggestive of septic arthritis of the left knee. Results of investigations did not support the diagnosis of infection of her left knee. There was genu varus deformity of her left knee, and she walked with an antalgic gait, occasionally requiring a walking frame for long-distance walking. She had never been hospitalised before. She was given two trials of oral antibiotics empirically but to no avail. Due to the persistent pain that had not resolved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy and antibiotics, she was referred to our orthopaedic department.\nAt our centre, we found there was muscular weakness in the lower extremities. Movement of the left knee was painful with limited range of movement of 0° to 90°. The skin in the affected knee was normal without signs of infection, vascular abnormalities or oedema. Peripheral pulses in the left lower limb were normal. The varus deformity of left knee was passively correctable. Radiograph of her left knee showed no progressive changes of the bone defect compared to the bone defect ten months previously. () Laboratory studies including haematological tests revealed no evidence of metabolic, neoplastic, immunological or infectious aetiology. She was then scheduled for total knee replacement for her left knee, six months later.\nHowever, while awaiting elective surgery, three months after presenting to our centre, she returned with complaint of right hip pain of three weeks duration. The right lower limb was shorter by two centimetres compared to the left lower limb. There was no history of trauma or infection. Radiograph of the right hip revealed complete osteolysis of the femoral head, though a radiograph three months earlier had shown a normal hip joint. () Laboratory studies again failed to disclose any significant findings for this occurrence as all the haematological tests were within normal limits. Sputum cultures for tuberculosis and Mantoux test were negative. Dual-energy x ray absorptiometry of the spine showed osteopenia. Her family history was non-contributory and no family members had an illness resembling hers.\nA CT-guided biopsy of the femoral head was performed. The histopathological results showed few bone trabeculae with many fragments of fibrovascular tissue. A few fragments showed entrapped skeletal muscle and trabeculae of osteoid with osteoblastic rimming. In addition, necrotic cartilage and isolated irregular clusters of amorphous hyaline material were present which stained equivocally with Congo red. There was no cellular evidence of atypia or malignancy. The findings were interpreted as osteocartilaginous necrosis, in keeping with disappearing bone disease.\nWe discussed the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment with the patient. After numerous consultations with the patient and her family members, consent was obtained for total knee replacement of her left knee and conservative management of her right hip. We performed arthroplasty for her knee. Histopathological findings from the tissues revealed findings consistent with disappearing bone disease. The patient’s left knee pain was markedly reduced post arthroplasty and she was able to resume her normal activities. There was no radiological evidence of periprosthetic loosening of the tibia implant three months post operation. Due to the good outcome of her left knee, the patient wished to have right hip arthroplasty. A year later, after confirming that the osteolysis had stopped through serial hip radiographs, total hip replacement was performed. At five years post-arthroplasties, she remains pain free and the fixations are stable without any evidence of subsidence.

"Our patient is a 38-year-old male who presented with right chest wall and shoulder pain after a weight lifting injury. The patient was performing a one-rep max bench press when he felt a pop in his right upper arm, accompanied by severe pain. There was no history of anabolic steroid use. He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ). He was scheduled for surgery in five days. Two days later, the patient returned to our facility with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm. Intracompartmental pressure readings in the anterior compartment of the arm taken about the midpoint of the biceps at the point of maximal swelling were 37, 39, and 42 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure of 71 mmHg (). Thus, with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome confirmed, we proceeded to the operating room for an emergency fasciotomy with repair of the pectoralis major tendon rupture.\nAn extended deltopectoral approach was used, and the deltopectoral and biceps fascia were released. Immediately, a large amount of hematoma was expelled and the muscle bellies visibly bulged from the incision sites (Figures and ). All muscles still appeared viable. No apparent vascular damage was noted. Upon further dissection, both heads of the pectoralis major were found to be avulsed from the proximal humerus (). After preparation of the footprint with curette and rongeur, three double-loaded 4.5 mm Mitek suture anchors (DePuy Synthes, Raynham, MA) were placed lateral to the bicipital groove for the repair of the tendon. The proximal and distal suture anchors were used such that one suture of each was run in a Krakow fashion along the superior and inferior aspects of the tendon, respectively. The remaining suture from each of those anchors was passed in a horizontal mattress fashion medial to the Krakow stitches. The middle suture anchor was used to place a horizontal mattress stitch with a medial ripstop stitch (). The wound was irrigated, and a negative pressure dressing was applied. The patient was made nonweightbearing and placed in a sling with a circumferential strap to ensure adduction of the arm. The patient returned to the operating room four days later to undergo irrigation and debridement with a tension-free primary wound closure. He was again placed into his sling and given strict instructions to avoid abduction and external rotation of the arm. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home in a stable condition that same day with a one-week follow-up appointment. He continued to do well and was instructed to remain nonweightbearing in his sling for a total of 6 weeks before beginning formal therapy. Gentle stretching and passive range of motion were then begun, followed by strengthening exercises at the 12th week mark. At his four-month follow-up, the patient had active forward flexion of the shoulder to 150°, abduction to 150°, and external rotation of 50°. His rotator cuff, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors, and interossei all demonstrated 5/5 strength. There were no sensory deficits on examination. He continues to attend therapy for motion and strengthening and has a lifting restriction of <5 pounds at work.","{

"A 59-year-old female initially presented to the emergency department 10 months prior with right arm pain and swelling. A computed tomography of the neck with contrast at the time showed two confluent masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions encasing the right subclavian and axillary vein, the internal mammary artery, and narrowing of the lower internal jugular vein. Patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient was evaluated by the oncology and radiation oncology services and underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Her course of chemotherapy was complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. Gradually, her pain of the right upper extremity worsened, and the patient was started on opioid therapy. Despite titration of her oral medications to extended release morphine 90 mg two times a day, immediate release morphine 30 mg every 2 to 3 hours, methadone 5 mg daily, and gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, her pain control remained suboptimal. She was referred to our pain clinic for further management of her intractable pain.\nOn presentation, the patient reported a constant 10/10 pain on the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) of the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. The pain was reported as dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature. Her pain was worsened by passive and active range of motion, and the pain at its best was a 7/10 with oral medications. Patient also reported progressive weakness of the entire right upper extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus was obtained, and the study revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus at the level of the divisions and cords as well as the right brachial artery ().\nDiagnostic brachial plexus block was performed in the hospital due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain. The brachial plexus was unable to be visualized using ultrasonography in the classic supraclavicular area due to the tumor effect, thus the block was performed at the level of the trunks using a lower interscalene approach. 18 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected under direct ultrasound guidance. The patient reported complete pain relief lasting approximately 12 hours after the nerve block. Given the success of the diagnostic nerve block, the patient was offered the option of chemical neurolytic brachial plexus block with an extensive discussion of the unique risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient elected to proceed to a right brachial plexus nerve block with dehydrated ethanol.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain upper abdomen', 'Feeling of fullness with small meals', 'Loss of appetite'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousCondition': 'Myocardial infarction', 'PastTreatment': 'Coronary angiography and stenting'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Growth at lower end of the stomach compromising gastric outlet'}, {'Test': 'Tissue biopsy', 'Finding': 'Adenocarcinoma of the stomach'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Complete gastric outlet obstruction with liver metastasis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Adenocarcinoma stomach', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Gastric outlet'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Feeding jejunostomy', 'Details': 'To support nutrition intake due to complete gastric outlet obstruction'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Awaiting chemotherapy post improvement', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient requires further treatment and supportive care'}}}"
"A 41-year-old man had been diagnosed as having a middle esophageal diverticulum based on an upper gastrointestinal contrast examination performed when he was 30 years old. He had not received treatment because he was asymptomatic. Eight months earlier, he experienced chest discomfort after eating and visited our hospital. His past history is pediatric asthma. The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position and four trocars inserted into the right thoracic cavity. A 12-mm trocar was inserted into the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. Only the left lung was ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest was created using CO2 gas at 6 mm. Twelve-mm trocars were inserted into the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle. A 5-mm trocar was then inserted into the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the ninth intercostal space at the level of the inferior scapular angle. The operator used the 12-mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the inferior scapular angle line and the 5 mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The assistant used the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The endoscope was inserted into the lumen of the upper thoracic esophagus before the patient was placed in the prone position and kept in the esophagus throughout the surgery. Confirmation of the middle esophageal diverticulum was easily achieved, but the area was difficult to exfoliate because the diverticular wall had adhered to the lymph nodes of the trachea bifurcation. To achieve a complete resection of the diverticulum, threads were placed on the oral and anal sides of the diverticulum, the threads were pulled. A thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line and the surgical stapler was inserted via the 12-mm port placed in the ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle, and the diverticulum was resected using two sets of the Tri-Stapler (Fig. ). A postoperative upper gastrointestinal contrast examination revealed no abnormalities (Fig. ). Oral intake was initiated on postoperative day 7, and he was discharged on postoperative day 12. The histopathological findings were a true diverticulum with a muscular layer and a highly inflamed mucosa. No malignant findings were seen (Fig. ). Postoperatively, the patient visited the hospital at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the surgery. He underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal contrast examination 1 year after the surgery. We found no evidence of recurrence of the esophageal diverticulum. We are planning to repeat the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 2 years after the surgery.","{

"A 64-year-old man with possible fracture of the shoulder was referred to an X-ray examination of his left shoulder. The X-ray visualized an osteolytic tumor in the proximal part of the left humerus and destruction of the cortex at the greater tuberosity (). Supplemental MRI showed a heterogeneous tumor of 4 × 6 cm, which was enhancing on the T1 sequences after contrast administration, and a periosteal reaction at the distal part of the tumor (). The cortical destruction and the contrast enhancing areas in the bone by MRI may suggest malignancy. The patient was referred to a national sarcoma center where a thorough medical history revealed that the patient had undergone left sided hemi-thyroidectomy 2 years previously due to a 5 cm follicular adenoma. He also had a malignant melanoma excised 8 years earlier from his left upper arm.\nA whole-body PET-CT confirmed the suspicion of malignant tumor in the proximal part of the left humerus and cortical destruction at the greater tuberosity (). A fat layer separated the tumor from the surrounding soft tissue, indicating that the tumor was only located to the bone. The PET-CT also revealed a small lymph node at the angle of the left mandible, suspected of being malignant. It was impossible to perform a biopsy of the lymph node due to its small size and location. Instead an ultrasound-guided histological biopsy was performed from the tumor in the left humerus, where cortical destruction enabled the needle to pass (). Histology revealed a carcinoma with morphology and immunohistochemical profile indicative of metastasis from the thyroid gland. The cells where characterized by abundant granular cytoplasm due to aberrant accumulation of mitochondria, which is a characteristic of oncocytes () ().\nDue to this, the patient underwent thyroidectomy of the right side and isthmus of the gland, excision of the lymph nodes on the right side of the neck, and excision of the PET-positive lymph node on the left side of the neck. None of the excised tissue did contain malignancy.\nBecause the primary cancer originating from thyroid tissue had not been located, the 2-year-old resected left lobe of the thyroid gland was re-evaluated. It had identical cytomorphology and the same immunohistochemical profile as the specimen from the tumor in the left humerus. There was no histological evidence of malignancy in any of the samples of the 5 cm tumor of the left thyroid lobe (). The patient was referred to the department of oncology in order to start medical therapy.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Patient presented for evaluation of brainstem fibrosarcoma treatment options', 'History of large pituitary adenoma in 1977', 'Developed left eyelid drooping and diplopia in 2003'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Concurrent hydrocephalus with VP shunt in 1977'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Large right brainstem lesion'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Right pontine enhancing mass consistent with grade 2 fibrosarcoma'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Brainstem fibrosarcoma', 'Type': 'Grade 2', 'Location': 'Right pontine region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Metronomic cyclophosphamide and Imatinib combination therapy', 'Details': 'Cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/day and Imatinib at 400 mg/day'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Slow improvement in neurologic function', 'DischargeStatus': 'Patient deceased due to bacterial pneumonia and sepsis'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Neurologic improvement observed'}}}"
"A male patient aged 19 years visited the Outpatient Department of Periodontics with a complaint of a defect in his gums and bad appearance of front teeth.\nThe patient was young, healthy with no significant medical history. His previous dental history revealed that he had a history of trauma 2 years back, in which his anterior teeth and right upper and lower central incisors were fractured. He underwent dental treatment for the same that included root canal therapy followed by crown placement on both the teeth. The patient remained asymptomatic for a year when he started noticing a defect in his gum related to his lower front teeth. He again visited the dentist where his scaling was done and was advised to massage his gums with a chlorhexidine gel. The patient had been regularly massaging his gum ever since and did not report back to his previous dentist to seek further treatment.\nHis intraoral examination revealed fair oral hygiene. Upper and lower right central incisors had a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown of which the lower was dislodged from the tooth. A mucosal with alveolar bone fenestration on the labial surface was apparent in relation to lower right mandibular central incisor, and a portion of the root which appeared apex of the root of mandibular right central incisor was visible through the defect []. The fenestration was slightly elongated in shape, measuring approximately 5 mm × 3 mm in diameter. The area was free of pus and calculus, and the surrounding gingiva appeared healthy. There were no periodontal pocket, no mobility, and no communication of fenestration with the gingival sulcus on periodontal probing. A transgingival probing or bone sounding under local anesthetic infiltration gave the impression of probable loss of alveolar bone along the length of the root facially. An intraoral periapical radiograph showed the concerned tooth slightly under obturated with diffuse radiolucency around its root []. The treatment was planned with repeat endodontic therapy in the affected tooth followed by periodontal surgical correction by raising a full-thickness flap.\nOn first sitting, the root exposed through the defect was scaled and planed and full-mouth scaling was also done. The internal surface of the gingiva and margin of the fenestration were gently curetted. The old obturated material was removed from the canal and was meticulously cleaned and reshaped using ProTaper files under copious irrigation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. The canal was medicated with calcium hydroxide paste, and the access cavity sealed for 1 week with a temporary restorative material. On the subsequent visit, the paste was flushed out of the canal using thorough irrigation with normal saline and dried and obturated with gutta-percha.\nAfter 1 week of endodontic treatment, periodontal surgery was carried out under local anesthesia. The thin epithelial lining of the mucosal defect was removed first with 11 No. blade [], followed by elevation of a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap []. There was a complete loss of alveolar cortical plate on the labial side up to the root apex, and the lower portion of the root showed a significant amount of calculus deposits []. Calculus from root was scaled, root planing was done, and the pathology was completely debrided from the surgical area []. Around 1 mm of the root apex was resected. Synthetic bone graft material β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) (resorbable tissue replacement [RTR] syringe–Septodont: RTR bone substitute of TCP) [] was packed into the defect, around the root apex and over the denuded root surface []. A bioresorbable collagen barrier membrane (PerioCol-GTR-Eucare Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, India: collagen membrane) [] was placed over the bone graft and sutured with resorbable sutures to the adjacent periosteum and connective tissue []. The elevated flap was replaced and sutured using interrupted sutures with 4–0 vicryl. The de-epithelized mucosal defect was also approximated and sutured []. Coe-Pak was placed over the surgical site, and the patient was given postoperative instructions. The patient had been prophylactically prescribed antibiotic, amoxicillin 500 mg, from the day before surgery and anti-inflammatory from the day of surgery for 5 days and was put on 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash. The patient was recalled for review after 7 days. Healing was uneventful and the follow-up visits showed complete healing and correction of mucosal defect [].","{

"A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history of lupus presented for elective left total knee arthroplasty following the development of osteoarthritis that had failed conservative measures. The patient had a history of previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system []. She underwent removal of the tibial WasherLoc approximately 10 years later, in the early 2000's ().\nThe patient was positioned supine; standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was then performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was placed and noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. At this time, it was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was then placed back on the femur and was noted to be in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The bone mulch screw was located and identified in the lateral femoral condyle; a curette was used to clear the head of the screw, and it was removed. The proximal tibia was then prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; the knee was noted to be tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. It was noted at this time while trying to trial the prostheses that the lateral femoral condyle was fractured. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted. The femoral canal was reamed, and the femoral box cut was made. However, during trialing, the medial femoral condyle was now noted to have a fracture as well. An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were then reamed to accept a 200 mm × 9 mm intramedullary nail to act as a temporary internal stabilization device (). The knee was irrigated and closed, and the patient was admitted to the floor. The patient was then brought back to the OR on postoperative day 3 following the index procedure. The prior incision was utilized; the wound was copiously irrigated. It was noted that due to the patient's poor bone quality and comminution of the fractures that the only viable option was a distal femoral replacement. The distal femur was resected, the femoral canal was reamed, and a planar was used on the distal femur. A skim cut and reaming of the tibia were performed. The components were trialed. Final implants included a 13 × 127 mm hinged femoral prosthesis and small 1-stemmed tibial tray; a 32 mm patellar component was used, and a size 10 polyethylene was then inserted; all components were cemented. The knee was noted to be stable throughout range of motion with good patellofemoral tracking. The surgical wound was copiously irrigated and closed (). Estimated blood loss was 100 mL; no postoperative transfusion was necessary. She was able to bear weight as tolerated immediately postoperatively. The patient's pain was controlled postoperatively, and she worked well with physical therapy and was discharged home with home health care on postoperative day two with 3 weeks of Coumadin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\nThe first postoperative visit was at two weeks; the patient had some swelling and quadriceps weakness, and the incision was healing well. Range of motion (ROM) was from 0-100°. At 6 weeks, she was still requiring narcotic medication; quadriceps strength was improving, ROM from 0-105°.\nAt 12 weeks, X-rays remained unchanged; the patient continued to have mild quadriceps weakness and was no longer requiring narcotic medications. ROM was not documented at this visit. At 6 months, ROM was 0-120°. The incision was well healed; X-rays were unchanged. The patient was doing well; however, she continued to have some residual quadriceps weakness and difficulty ambulating long distances. The patient was lost to follow-up after 6 months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula', 'History of failed attempts to close the fistula'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Plasmacytoma enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT Scan', 'Finding': '3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Orocotaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Complication', 'Location': 'Medial side of the left mandible'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect', 'Details': 'Excision of fistula, preparation of healthy soft tissues, dissection of submandibular gland, rotation of gland with soft tissue tunnel, suturing at recipient site, and closure of flap layers'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Ideal closure of the fistula observed'}}}"
"A 26-year-old Indian woman was admitted to our gastroenterology unit with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction with features of massive malena at 29 weeks of gestation. She had a previous pregnancy that resulted in a single offspring. She was referred for an antenatal check-up to our obstetric unit, where after clinical examination, an ultrasonography was performed which revealed gross fetal hydrops. She was transferred to our obstetric unit for further evaluation and management.\nHer prenatal course was complicated by recurrent episodes of hematemesis and malena for 10 years prior to admission and she was previously diagnosed with esophageal varices. She had a history of multiple blood transfusions and sclerotherapy sessions. Her first pregnancy was 2 years prior to admission, in which she had regular supervised antenatal checkups on her first and second trimesters with a normal anomaly scan. Her pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus that was controlled through diet. She had episodes of recurrent malena in this pregnancy. Her third trimester was unsupervised at home and she was admitted to a local private practitioner at the onset of her labour. She underwent caesarean section for meconium-stained liquor. She delivered a grossly normal male baby with jaundice at birth. Details pertaining to the baby are not available, but the baby had received a blood transfusion on the third day of life and died on the seventh day.\nHer present pregnancy was a spontaneous conception. Her first and second trimester antenatal checkups were with a private practitioner in her hometown. She presented in the gastroenterology department of our institute at 29 weeks of gestation with massive malena and anemia. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed the presence of grade II esophageal varices for which sclerotherapy was done. She was given three units of packed red blood cells to raise her haemoglobin from 6 gm% to 10 gm%. Upon obstetric referral, ultrasonography at 30 weeks and 5 days revealed severe fetal hydrops. Doppler studies were suggestive of fetal anemia. She was given corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity. At 31 weeks, cordocentesis was done and intravascular intrauterine fetal transfusion with O-negative cross-matched blood was given. Since she was Rhesus (D) O type positive, non-immune hydrops was suspected. Fetal blood was thus sent for blood grouping, haemoglobin, haematocrit, TORCH serology, parvovirus B19 serology, haemoglobin electrophoresis, G6PD enzyme assay and karyotype.\nThe results of fetal echocardiography were normal. Fetal blood group was A-positive and was negative in workup for non-immune hydrops. Maternal serum indirect Coomb's test was positive, thus leading to a suspicion of the presence of non-anti-D antibodies. A special request was sent to the blood bank to screen for uncommon rare blood groups and non-D antibodies. Anti-c was detected in maternal serum in 1:4 dilutions.\nMaternal blood was resent to the blood bank to establish exact Rhesus haplotype, which was determined to be R1R1 (CDe/CDe). The fetus was monitored with bi-weekly biophysical profiling and a second intrauterine transfusion was given one week later with compatible O-negative and c-negative cross-matched blood. At 32 weeks and 5 days, an emergency caesarean section was done due to poor biophysical profile.\nA grossly hydropic female baby with a birth weight of 1.6 kg was born with massive ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, pallor and hypotonia. At birth, 150 ml of ascitic tap was done and the baby was transferred to the nursery on bag and tube ventilation. Her cord blood hematocrit was 15 and total serum bilirubin was 6.5 mg/dl. A partial exchange transfusion followed by double volume exchange transfusion with O-positive, c-negative blood was performed. Intravenous immunoglobulin in doses of 1 gram/kg was administered after the exchange. The baby required intense phototherapy for 4 days. By the second week, she developed conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to inspissated bile syndrome, which resolved on its own. The baby was then managed conservatively and was discharged in stable condition on the 30th day of her life.\nThe fetal rhesus haplotype was established finally as cDe/cDe. The source of maternal isoimmunisation may be either fetomaternal haemorrhage in the mother s current or previous pregnancy or from multiple blood transfusions.","{

"A 64-year-old female, with multiple previous hospitalizations for acute heart failure, was admitted for shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and increasing abdominal size in her local hospital emergency department with subsequent hospitalization. She had a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, secondary severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and permanent atrial fibrillation. As part of the sequence of heart failure therapies, the patient also had a previous implant of an ICD for primary prevention 5 years before.\nDuring hospitalization, the patient developed diverse infectious complications which contributed to a slow resolution of acute heart failure, with the need of many days of inotropic and vasopressor support and subsequent suboptimization of heart failure therapy. As the patient was recognized as having criteria for advanced heart failure, she was referred and transferred to our advanced heart failure center.\nFollowing admission to our hospital, an ECG was performed, showing ventricular paced rhythm with RBBB pattern in V1 through V5 leads and extreme right axis displacement of the mean QRS in the frontal plane clearly indicating an electrical activation from the left ventricle [], which raised suspicion of ICD lead malposition. Chest radiography was performed also showing an abnormal lead path, suggestive of implantation of the lead in the left ventricle []. To confirm our suspicion, our patient then performed a transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed biventricular dilatation with moderate systolic dysfunction, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and signs of right ventricular pressure overload with plethoric inferior vena cava and abnormal septal motion with systolic “flattening” toward the left ventricle. Peak systolic gradient between the right ventricle and the right atrium was normal, probably underestimated because of right ventricular dysfunction and severe enlargement of the right atrium. However, the implanted ICD appeared to pass through the interatrial septum, with its lead tip in contact with the midsegment of the left ventricular anterolateral wall [-]. Our patient also underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram to better clarify valvular regurgitations and the behavior of the ICD lead at the level of the interatrial septum [-].\nInitially, our patient registered an important decrease in body weight and improvement in symptoms; however, after many days of stay, her hospitalization was complicated with refractory ascites and cardiogenic shock, with fast progression in INTERMACS classification. As our patient reached INTERMACS Level 2, we launched a desperate appeal for cardiac transplantation, as neither extracorporeal membrane oxygenation nor left ventricular assist devices were available at our center at the time. After a couple of days, we got contacted as there was an available heart, and our patient was promptly transferred to our cardiac surgery unit where she underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. Analysis of the explanted heart confirmed the presence in the left ventricle of the ICD catheter. Immediate postoperative course was favorable with extubation after 24 h, requiring inotropic support with dobutamine for 2 days with no need for mechanical support. The patient was discharged after 72 days after transplantation, and to this day remains symptom-free with no further hospitalizations.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Underwent IVF for tubal factor infertility', 'Initial ultrasound showed twin pregnancy with one sac low towards the cervical canal and one towards the fundus', 'One episode of bleeding pervaginum', 'Diagnosis of threatened abortion', 'Fetal reduction of cervical pregnancy performed under general anesthesia', 'Readmitted at 28 weeks with intrauterine growth retardation', 'Lower segment cesarean section performed at 31 weeks'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Tubal factor infertility'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Early Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Twin pregnancy, one sac low towards cervical canal and one towards fundus'}, {'Test': 'Repeat Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Confirmed intrauterine and cervical heterotopic pregnancy'}, {'Test': 'Fetal Doppler Study', 'Finding': 'Reduced umbilical blood flows with adequate liquor and normal middle cerebral artery blood flows'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Tubal factor infertility', 'Type': 'Reproductive issue', 'Location': 'Female reproductive organs'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Fetal reduction of cervical pregnancy', 'Details': 'Performed under general anesthesia by injecting intrathoracic potassium chloride'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Satisfactory', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6th post-operative day', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient and baby doing fine post-natally'}}}"
"A 46-year-old premenopausal woman underwent mastectomy and axillary clearance in 1993 for multifocal right breast malignancy. Histology demonstrated an 8 mm grade 1 carcinoma and 10 and 25 mm grade 3 carcinomas. There was no nodal involvement. Hormone receptor status was not assessed but she was prescribed adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years.\nAlmost 10 years later, in December 2002, our patient underwent a left mastectomy and axillary clearance for a 23 mm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma showing vascular invasion and involving 2 axillary lymph nodes. The carcinoma was only focally ER positive and PR negative, but c-erbB2 strongly positive. She received adjuvant chemotherapy [6 cycles FEC] and chest wall radiotherapy, and in view of the albeit weak ER positivity, she was started again on tamoxifen.\nIn August 2004 she complained of back pain. An MRI scan demonstrated multiple bone metastases in the cervical and thoracic spine, and there was some spinal cord compression at T3. A good symptomatic response followed palliative radiotherapy to the upper thoracic spine, and this was followed by 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab, a change in her hormonal treatment from tamoxifen to letrozole, and a 2-year course of bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid infusions. She continued indefinitely on the three weekly infusions of trastuzumab.\nThe response was maintained for 2 years, but slight nausea and newly abnormal liver function biochemistry led to a CT scan in August 2006. This showed a 9 cm, apparently solitary, lower right liver lobe metastasis in addition to the numerous sclerotic bone metastases. There was no clinical or investigative evidence of disease progression at any site other than in the liver. The liver metastasis was involving both the left and right portal inflows and was considered inoperable. It was decided to continue with trastuzumab but to treat again with docetaxel chemotherapy. She received another 6 cycles and the diameter of the metastasis reduced by more than 50%. It was then considered operable and following an extended right hepatectomy in March 2007, she made an uneventful swift recovery.\nOur patient remained symptomatically well until November 2007, when her upper thoracic spine again became painful. An MRI scan showed some improvement in the degree of bone involvement compared with the MRI scan in 2004, but in view of the pain she was retreated with palliative radiotherapy, to good effect. She continued on trastuzumab and letrozole, and remained symptomatically well until June 2008 when she developed headache, dizziness and vomiting, and a CT scan showed an apparently solitary 33 mm left cerebellar metastasis. She underwent craniotomy and gross total resection. This was followed by whole brain radiotherapy, 40 Gy in 20 fractions, and she made a good recovery.\nA now ‘routine’ 6-monthly whole body CT scan in May 2010, showed a new 2.3 cm lesion in the right adrenal gland. PET CT demonstrated that this was the only significant source of uptake. There was only mild residual activity in the bone metastases and the brain and liver were clear. Adrenalectomy was undertaken in June 2010, histology confirming a 30 × 20 mm metastasis of poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma with moderate ER and weak PR positivity.\nOur patient continues on the trastuzumab and letrozole combination she has now taken for over six years and is currently [April 2011] symptomatically very well and continuing to enjoy a good quality of life, her metastatic bone disease remaining quiescent. She will shortly be receiving her 110th trastuzumab infusion.","{

"A 35-year-old man has been referred to our Dermatology Clinic with the complaint of painful firm immobile nodules along with a surgical scar on the dorsum of his hand. There were also pus drainage and ulceration in some part of the scar. He claimed that there was a tumoral swelling at the dorsum of his left hand in the second metacarpal area for 12 months. It had been gradually increased in size and led to the restriction of the movement of the index finger. Therefore, he came to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent a tumor excision operation about six months ago. He completely improved after this surgery and did not follow up any further treatment. Four months after the surgery, some painful immobile ulcerated nodules with low discharge appeared on the way of the surgical scar. He works as an electrical technician but there was no obvious history of trauma or significant medical problem. Physical examination showed swollen areas at the dorsum of the left hand and palpable tender immobile nodules on the surgical scar with low discharge. Some nodules showed ulcerated crusted surface ().\nThe hematological and biochemical laboratory tests were normal. The hand radiography was done and reported as normal. Therefore, he underwent an incisional biopsy of the nodules. Microscopic examination reveals an ulcerated epidermis with underlying neutrophilic microabscesses surrounded by granulation tissues consisting of plasma cell, macrophage, and fibroblast infiltration. Sulfur granules were found at the center of these inflammatory reactions as filamentous basophilic radiating fungal-like structures in the dermis (Figures and ).\nRegarding these clinical and histopathological data, the diagnosis of actinomycosis was made. Moreover, we asked the patient to bring us any histopathology report of the tumor excised on his hand about one year before his admission. Surprisingly, the diagnosis of actinomycosis had also been mentioned in that report. But he had not come to his surgeon for any further treatment and the recurrence of the lesions occurred on the surgical scar. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin G for four weeks and then oral penicillin. Resolution of symptoms and sings occurred but the patient did not come back for further follow-up.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Presented with pain in the right shoulder and inability to move without discomfort', 'History of head injuries sustained 4 weeks prior', 'Total restriction of abduction in the right shoulder'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Head injuries sustained during assault, managed on an indoor basis for 16 days'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographs of the shoulder', 'Finding': 'Proximal humerus fracture with inferiorly dislocated head and migration of distal fragment'}, {'Test': 'Axillary view', 'Finding': 'Confirmation of head dislocation and callus formation around the fracture site'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Proximal humerus fracture with dislocation', 'Type': 'Trauma', 'Location': 'Right shoulder'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Open reduction and reconstruction', 'Details': 'Shortening of distal fragment by 2 cm to facilitate reduction, reattachment of supraspinatus, and reefing of other muscles and joint capsule'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Pendular exercises and gradual range of motion exercises', 'DischargeStatus': 'Pain-free with improved range of motion'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1 year', 'FunctionalStatus': 'More than normal internal rotation, limited abduction, able to perform routine duties'}}}"
"The case involved is a 53 year-old female who experienced a loss of right visual acuity after endoscopic sinus surgery under local anesthesia at a local clinic one day prior to being admitted to our department. Her past surgical history included both endoscopic sinus surgery, which had been performed 15 years previously at another local ENT clinic. Immediately after recent right endoscopic sinus surgery, the right eye had no light perception. The orbital CT from the local radiology center showed a small right medial wall fracture. () A thick bony septa observed in the right ethmoid area. () On the first day of admission in our hospital (2 days after surgery), steroid therapy was started for traumatic optic neuropathy. Steroid pulse therapy was treated for 4 days, and then prednisolone orally for 10 days. On the second day of admission, a visual evoked potential (VEP) test revealed the absence of right optic nerve activity (P100: not detected, flat wave). After steroid treatment for 2 weeks, light perception was absent. Orbital MRI was performed on the second day of admission and showed a mild enhancement of the posterior half of the right optic nerve sheath, and a dark signal focus of medial rectus muscle near the right orbit apex (). Two months after ESS, her visual acuity remained zero.\nOptic nerve injury that occurs during ESS usually happens when the operation is performed under general anesthesia. Under local anesthesia, optic nerve injury can be prevented because the patient complains of pain the moment that the lamina papyracea is broken. Optic nerve injury under general anesthesia may occur under the following circumstances; 1) When the surgeon relies on his own experience rather than precise anatomical knowledge; 2) When preoperative CT has not been fully reviewed, or 3) When the operation is conducted without frequently checking the position and direction of the endoscope. Blindness is a rare complication, and can result from; direct damage to the optic nerve by surgical instruments, loss of blood supply to the optic nerve, or indirect damage to the optic nerve due to optic nerve compression by a retrobulbar hematoma. However, in many cases, it is not easy to determine whether blindness has been caused by direct or indirect damage.\nThe reason why direct damage to the optic nerve occurs especially around the posterior ethmoid sinus, may be explained by the proximity of the lamina papyracea and the optic nerve, and the fact that it is difficult for the surgeon to be aware of the break through the lamina papyracea because of the thin fat layer at this site. Morever, aerated posterior ethmoid air cells alongside the optic canal (Onodi cells) occur in a few people and these may place the optic nerve at greater risk of injury during ethmoidectomy.-\nThe mechanisms of blindness caused by indirect injury are a loss of blood supply to the retina or optic nerve compression. Retinal blood supply is sustained by branches of the internal ophthalmic artery, namely the posterior ciliary artery and central retinal artery. Since the central retinal artery and medial posterior ciliary artery run along the inferolateral and medial portions of the optic nerve respectively, they can be easily injured during ESS.-\nTotal blindness, that is irreversible damage, may result from central retinal artery injury due to a loss of blood to the retina; however, ischemic optic neuropathy is more likely to occur when the medial posterior ciliary artery is injured, because it is not a major feeding vessel. Retrobulbar hematoma due to optic nerve compression can be easily diagnosed by proptosis and a stony hard orbit. Measures undertaken to release the pressure, such as orbital massage, lateral canthotomy, and steroid administration can prevent blindness to some degree.,\nIn this study, all three cases presented with optic nerve damage at the posterior ethmoid sinus, and cases 2 and 3 were revision cases. Case 2 was under general anesthesia and case 1 and 3 were under local anesthesia. In cases 1, and 3, direct damage to the optic nerve was presumed since the patient suddenly felt a sharp pain during the operation. In case 3, the surgeon mistook the thick ethmoid bony septum as the middle turbinate during operation. Retrobulbar hematoma was accompanied in case 2 only. In that case, early orbital apex decompression or optic nerve decompression would be helpful because lateral canthotomy and steroids did not bring the vision back. Since no improvement of blindness was observed despite steroid administration in all 3 cases and after the management of retrobulbar hematoma in case 2, we suggest that in the majority of cases blindness may be irreversible and that the prevention of optic nerve damage by a thorough preoperative review of the patient is most important.\nEspecially in revision cases, thickening of the ethmoid septa and displacement of the ethmoid septa can cause the incorrect recognition of structures in the operative field and therefore careful attention is needed. Also, in case of a lateralized middle turbinate, severe septal mucosal hypertrophy, and high septal deviation, care must be taken because the endoscope can easily head laterally.\nIt is important to frequently check the location and direction of the endoscope during surgery, to avoid optic nerve injury. In addition, surgeons must have precise knowledge of the detailed anatomy through cadaver dissections, the ability to interpret the PNS CT scan and experienced procedural surgical skills.","{

"A 28-year-old female had experienced intermittent abdominal pain for 3 months and visited the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea, for further evaluation and treatment. An abdominal-pelvic computed tomography scan taken in January 2010 at the Asan Medical Center revealed a huge mass involving most of the lower abdomen and pelvic cavity with multiple septations and areas of enhancement (). The provisional diagnosis on the basis of the image findings was either borderline or malignant ovarian neoplasm. Neither ascites nor metastatic lymphadenopathy was found.\nThe patient had a history of radical nephrectomy for Wilms' tumor of the right kidney 25 years previously, at the age of 3 years, in April 1985 at an outside hospital. After surgery, she had been treated with intravenous injection of dactinomycin 25 mcg for 5 days and vincristine 1 mg on the 7th day after the operation. Since then, she had been healthy with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis until she noticed abdominal pain in September 2009.\nUnder the clinical diagnosis of an ovarian tumor, the pelvic mass was resected in February 2010. During surgery, the mass was noted to occupy the entire lower abdominal cavity without involving both adnexa. Intraoperative consultation was made and the frozen section diagnosis was malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor or other malignant mesenchymal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma with pending evaluation of permanent sections.\nThe original slides of the Wilms' tumor, resected 25 years ago, could not be reviewed because the slides were not available in the file of the outside hospital. However, the outside pathology report stated that the size of the tumor was 12 cm and it was located at the right kidney. The tumor was abutting the head of the pancreas, and in the operation record it was written that the tumor was not completely excised. Microscopically, the tumor was shown to be a classic Wilms' tumor with predominant epithelial tubular elements and minor blastemal and mesenchymal components. No anaplasia or lymphovascular invasion was recorded, and the mitotic count was stated as scant. The final diagnosis of the nephrectomy specimen was Wilms' tumor, stage III.\nGrossly, the resected tumor in February 2010 was a 30-cm, previously ruptured, solid and cystic mass. On the cut surface, the tumor was heterogeneous, pinkish tan to yellow, and had both solid and friable areas. Multifocal hemorrhagic, cystic, and necrotic changes were also noted (). Microscopically, the tumor was composed of three different cell types, epithelial, mesenchymal, and blastemal components (). Areas of tumor necrosis were seen (). The mesenchymal tumor cells were short, spindle-shaped to round cells with scanty cytoplasm in a myxoid background (). The epithelial cell component formed tumor cell nests with glandular architecture (). The majority of the tumor compartment was an undifferentiated blastemal cell component. Mitoses were frequently observed up to 30/10 HPFs, particularly in the blastemal component. Hyperchromatism was also observed, but significant pleomorphism was not obvious (). Immunohistochemical staining was done and the results were as follows: focal positive for cytokeratin in the epithelial component but negative in the blastemal and mesenchymal components (). The Ki-67 labeling index was positive in about 50% of the tumor cells (), and p53 staining was positive in about one third of the tumor cells in all three elements. The immunohistochemical staining for WT-1, S-100 protein, SMA, desmin, myogenin, myoglobin, CD117, and CD34 was negative in all three components.\nOn the basis of the histologic findings in conjunction with the immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a recurrent classic Wilms' tumor without anaplastic changes.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe pain and swelling in left hip and upper thigh region following trauma for 2 days', 'Unable to walk and bear weight on left lower limb'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Hip hemireplacement operation on left side 5 years back'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Plain radiographs', 'Finding': 'Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic fracture with broken cemented bipolar prosthesis insitu'}, {'Test': 'Blood investigations', 'Finding': 'Normal limits'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Periprosthetic fracture with broken cemented bipolar prosthesis', 'Type': 'Orthopedic', 'Location': 'Left hip and upper thigh region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Proximal femoral mega prosthesis implantation', 'Details': 'Long stem steel cemented prosthesis implantation with abductor reattachment'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Asymptomatic, pain-free, walks independently without support', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Totally asymptomatic, pain-free, walks independently without support'}}}"
"We present a 10 year old male, who presented with a history of recurrent seizures and impaired speech development from the age of 6 months, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior and poor academic performance of 5 years duration. Informant was the mother. The seizures were described as afebrile and generalized tonic-clonic in nature. The child received several medications, from the hospital of his birth and other secondary health care facilities, for the seizures. Parents introduced traditional herbal oral medication at 2 years when seizures remained intractable, and which he continued till presentation at the CAMH unit. Speech has remained audible but incomprehensible since the 6th month of life till date and has not received any specific therapy for this. Though described as socially interactive with people he was observed to be hyperactive and aggressive in the past 5 years. These features, in addition to the recurrent seizures even in school had resulted in poor academic performance. Persistent complaints and rejection by schools culminated in complete withdrawal from school. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Developmental motor milestones were described as normal until the 9th month of life when parents observed comparative weakness in the left upper and lower limbs. He started walking with a limp at 2 years. He developed a facial rash at 5 years which has increased in spread and defied repeated administration of a variety of topical skin creams. He was first diagnosed as having cerebral palsy at 2 years. It was at 5 years of age that a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis was made in a tertiary health facility. After 2 years of several visits to this facility, the parents stopped attending due to lack of significant improvement in the child's condition and non availability of the special health services such as speech therapy. Currently he is at home and away from school. He is being tendered to by his mother, who had to relinquish her career pursuit, and two hired house helps. There was no family history of seizures. Father is a 37 year old salesman. The child has two younger siblings who have no growth or developmental challenges. Expenses incurred in the care of child were described as prohibitive and have been borne exclusively by the parents. On a monthly basis, his care is said to consume over a third of the family resources. Parents are not aware of any support group or supportive governmental program they can access. Increasing inappropriate hostility towards parents, relatives and other caregivers in addition to the associated difficulty in restraining him and the embarrassment the parents feel from his untoward activities informed his presentation to the CAMH Unit. On examination at presentation he was hyperactive but well kempt. He had Adenoma Sebaceum []. Weight, height and occipito- frontal circumference were appropriate for age. Other significant findings were expressive language disorder and left hemiplegia. Chest x-ray, abdominal ultra sonography and audiogram were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) indicated generalized tonic clonic-seizures. A CT-Scan showed intra-ventricular subependymal calcifications []. He had features of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Outcome of draw-a-person test was very poor. Overall, a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis with mental retardation, left hemiplegia and ADHD was made. Outlined management included parental counseling, physiotherapy for the hemiplegia, sodium valproate and methyl phenidate were prescribed for seizures and ADHD respectively. The frequency of the seizures and the degree of hyperactivity reduced with commencement of the drugs. The child and parents were subsequently introduced to a special education and rehabilitation facility in the community.","{

"A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history of lupus presented for elective left total knee arthroplasty following the development of osteoarthritis that had failed conservative measures. The patient had a history of previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system []. She underwent removal of the tibial WasherLoc approximately 10 years later, in the early 2000's ().\nThe patient was positioned supine; standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was then performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was placed and noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. At this time, it was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was then placed back on the femur and was noted to be in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The bone mulch screw was located and identified in the lateral femoral condyle; a curette was used to clear the head of the screw, and it was removed. The proximal tibia was then prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; the knee was noted to be tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. It was noted at this time while trying to trial the prostheses that the lateral femoral condyle was fractured. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted. The femoral canal was reamed, and the femoral box cut was made. However, during trialing, the medial femoral condyle was now noted to have a fracture as well. An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were then reamed to accept a 200 mm × 9 mm intramedullary nail to act as a temporary internal stabilization device (). The knee was irrigated and closed, and the patient was admitted to the floor. The patient was then brought back to the OR on postoperative day 3 following the index procedure. The prior incision was utilized; the wound was copiously irrigated. It was noted that due to the patient's poor bone quality and comminution of the fractures that the only viable option was a distal femoral replacement. The distal femur was resected, the femoral canal was reamed, and a planar was used on the distal femur. A skim cut and reaming of the tibia were performed. The components were trialed. Final implants included a 13 × 127 mm hinged femoral prosthesis and small 1-stemmed tibial tray; a 32 mm patellar component was used, and a size 10 polyethylene was then inserted; all components were cemented. The knee was noted to be stable throughout range of motion with good patellofemoral tracking. The surgical wound was copiously irrigated and closed (). Estimated blood loss was 100 mL; no postoperative transfusion was necessary. She was able to bear weight as tolerated immediately postoperatively. The patient's pain was controlled postoperatively, and she worked well with physical therapy and was discharged home with home health care on postoperative day two with 3 weeks of Coumadin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\nThe first postoperative visit was at two weeks; the patient had some swelling and quadriceps weakness, and the incision was healing well. Range of motion (ROM) was from 0-100°. At 6 weeks, she was still requiring narcotic medication; quadriceps strength was improving, ROM from 0-105°.\nAt 12 weeks, X-rays remained unchanged; the patient continued to have mild quadriceps weakness and was no longer requiring narcotic medications. ROM was not documented at this visit. At 6 months, ROM was 0-120°. The incision was well healed; X-rays were unchanged. The patient was doing well; however, she continued to have some residual quadriceps weakness and difficulty ambulating long distances. The patient was lost to follow-up after 6 months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula post previous surgeries', 'History of plasmacytoma enucleation from left mandible'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastSurgery': 'Three unsuccessful attempts to close orocutaneous fistula by local flaps'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': '3 × 2 cm defect between left mouth floor and basis of left mandible'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Orocotaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Complication', 'Location': 'Medial side of left mandible'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Use of submandibular gland as pedicled flap to fill defect', 'Details': 'Excision of fistula, preparation of healthy soft tissues, mobilization and rotation of submandibular gland to fill defect'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Ideal closure of fistula observed'}}}"
"A 43-year-old man had no notable findings on a past history, and he worked in a moving company. Due to the pain in the neck and shoulder, the patient received a cervical massage from a massage therapist with a private certificate at a massage center in Kyounggi province, in March of 2008. The massage was performed in such a manner that the massage therapist pressed the patient's back with the palm and then pushed it in an upward direction from the thoracic to the cervical in a prone position. During the massage, the patient had a sensation of paralysis in the right upper and lower extremities. Because the weakness was not severely notable, however, the patient returned home with no other specific treatments. On the evening of that day, the patient felt a weakness in all the extremities, and then visited an emergency care center of another hospital. An OPLL was revealed in the fifth cervical spine on a cervical computed tomography, which was performed at an emergency care center (). On a cervical magnetic resonance imaging, there was an acute herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) between the C5 and C6. Further, T2-weighted images showed a high signal intensity, which is indicative of myeolopathy around the sixth cervical spine (). The patient had undergone a sixth cervical corpectomy, the anterior cervical fusion and the device fixation for the fifth to seventh cervical spine, the posterior cervical fusion and the device fixation for the third to seventh cervical spine and the posterior laminectomy for the fourth to the sixth cervical spine ().\nFour months following the onset of the trauma, the patient was referred to the department of rehabilitation medicine in our hospital to receive a comprehensive rehabilitative treatment. The results of a manual muscle test and sensation test are shown in . Based on a neurologic level of injury of C4 and an ASIA Impairment Scale of D according to the criteria of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), the patient was diagnosed with incomplete spinal cord injury (). In addition, an electrophysiologic test was also performed at four months following the onset of the trauma. The sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were normal and no significant difference was noted between both sides. On a needle electromyography, abnormal spontaneous activities were found in the right C5-C7, the left C4-C5, C6-C7 paraspinal muscles, the both triceps brachii, the flexor carpi radialis, the extensor digitorum communis and the first dorsal interosseous muscles. Besides, the recruitment patterns of the motor unit action potentials were decreased in both triceps brachii, the flexor carpi radialis and the extensor digitorum communis muscles. These led to the diagnosis of bilateral lower cervical radiculopathy. The muscle stretch reflexes were increased in the upper and lower extremities on both sides. Hoffmann's sign and ankle clonus were observed on both sides. The patient was able to walk using a walker at indoors, and he needed a minimal assist to perform activities of daily living, such as grooming, feeding, dressing, transfer from a bed to a wheelchair and a gait. But, the patient needed a moderate assist to perform such activities as toileting and bathing. Therefore, the Korea spinal cord independence measure (KSCIM) was 67/100. Following a 3-week of comprehensive rehabilitative therapy, the patient was discharged in such a condition that the patient walked independently indoors with a right ankle foot orthosis.\nThe patient received a physical and occupational therapy, and was monitored of the clinical course at an outpatient clinic of the rehabilitation medicine in our institution. Three years after the trauma, a manual muscle test showed that the muscle strength was increased in the left elbow extensor, both finger abductor, the right hip flexor, the right ankle dorsiflexor, the right ankle plantar flexor, and the right great toe extensor muscles. The pain and temperature sensation were normal up to the level of T8/T4 (right/left), and the proprioception was improved to the normal range at all the spinal levels. This led to changes in a neurologic level of an injury to C6 (). Furthermore, the patient was able to perform most of the activities of daily living, including outdoor walking and driving, without an orthosis. Therefore, the score of KSCIM was 97/100. But the patient needed to hold a balustrade, while going up and down the stairs, used a fork because of the difficulty in using a chopstick when having a meal, and usually wore clothes without buttons because of the difficulty in manipulating the buttons. That is, the patient had a restriction in going up and down the stairs and performing a fine motor coordination.","{

"A 32-year-old woman who had been attempting to achieve pregnancy for 6 years was referred to our reproductive medicine centre with a request for intracytoplasmic sperm injection in October 2016. The indication was primary infertility, and her husband had asthenozoospermia and teratospermia. At 3 days after oocyte retrieval, the patient presented to our hospital complaining of 7 hours of right lower quadrant and right flank pain with nausea and vomiting for no known cause. Her temperature and blood pressure were normal. An abdominal examination showed normal bowel sounds, moderate right lower quadrant tenderness, and voluntary guarding. A vaginal examination showed a tender mass of 10 cm at the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness. An ultrasound scan indicated hyperstimulation with enlarged ovaries that measured 97 × 68 mm (right ovary) and 71 × 50 mm (left ovary), and excessive fluid in the pelvic area. Doppler imaging showed diminished right ovarian vascular flow compared with the left ovary. A diagnosis of OHSS with right ovarian torsion was made and an emergency operation was immediately performed. At laparoscopy, there was approximately 500 ml of clear ascitic fluid. The right ovary was 9 × 6 × 5 cm in size, dark blue, and the pedicle was twisted 360 degrees (). The left ovary appeared healthy, was 5 × 4 × 4 cm in size, and had multiple follicles on the surface. At 5 minutes after untwisting the right pedicle, there was an improvement of colour. We continued observation until the right ovary, as well as the fallopian tube, turned a similar colour to the left ovary 30 minutes later (). At 9 days after operation, an ultrasound scan indicated that the right ovary was 63 × 48 mm in size with good blood flow signals. The patient was then discharged. On 3 April 2017, frozen-thawed embryo transfer was performed, and her pregnancy test 12 days later was positive.

"A 17-year-old female presented with a history of osteosarcoma that was confirmed after undergoing a surgery to remove an enlarging bone tumor in the left temporal region 2 years ago. She later got pregnant and delivered her child but never got back for a checkup until she was admitted to our hospital with a severe and unresponsive to medication headache that progressed over the course of 6 months and blurred vision that progressed to complete left-sided vision loss. Physical examination revealed a tough and mobile yet fixed at the base 7-cm mass towards the left of the frontal bone. Many more masses were revealed in the left side of the skull including the anterior cranial fossa, orbit, base of the skull and the left part of the occipital region where the previous procedure was performed (). These masses had been increasing in size probably under the influence of pregnancy hormones causing pain that radiated along the orbital and maxillary branches of the left trigeminal nerve. Physical examination and past medical history were otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory tests were all normal, and her family history was negative. Staging studies showed no evidence of distant metastatic disease in the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis. CT scan of the skull revealed a bone-forming non-lytic lesion accompanied by periosteal reaction. This lesion bulges to the outside towards the scalp spreading into both the soft tissues and the inside of the entire left side of the skull with a sunburst-pattern ( and ). Its rims are unsymmetrical and pointy, and it bulges into the left orbit outside the muscles causing exophthalmos with a semi-complete proptosis of the eyeball out of the orbit ( and ). This lesion applies pressure to the left frontal and temporal lobes causing mild edema in both these lobes without invading the brain tissue. This edema in turn applies pressure to the left lateral ventricles (minor shift of the elements of the midline to the right side can be seen on CT) (). Due to the tumor’s wide spread, the surgical procedure was performed in two stages (approximately 6-hour-long each). In the first stage, the bone mass was removed through a procedure of wide skull approach including the frontal, temporal and parietal bones and a removal of the invading part of the temporal muscle. Moreover, the lateral wall and roof of the left orbit were removed, the left optic nerve was dissected free and part of the meninges was removed and replaced with an autogenic patch from the fascia lata. Then, the bone loss was compensated for by using bone cement Synicem VTP (poly methyl methacrylate and Barium sulfate), and the orbit was rebuilt; the eyeball was placed back with noticeable decline of the exophthalmos. In the second stage, a complementary left parietal occipital incision of the previous approach was performed 3 weeks later; the remaining of the frontal and occipital bones was removed, and a partial mastoid surgery was done. Furthermore, the cavernous sinus were revealed and found to be not invaded. Later on, the normal skull shape was restored using the same cement. The histopathology of the lesion revealed proliferation of neoplastic chondroblasts, osteoblasts and spindle-shaped cells. The features are consistent with low-grade chondroblastic osteosarcoma (). The patient did not need ICU admission. She recovered well 3 days after the surgery and was discharged with no deficits. A CT scan that was performed post-operatively revealed that the masses were successfully excised ( and ). At the last follow-up 1 month post-operation, the patient was scheduled to undergo a course of radiotherapy, 60 Gy of radiotherapy in 30 fractions over 4 weeks without chemotherapy, as it is not recommended with low-grade osteosarcoma.","{

"A 39-year-old female was admitted into our clinic with a complaint of a 3-month history of a slowly growing mass along the neck midline. The physical examination revealed a 3 × 1.5 cm immobile mass along the neck midline over the thyrohyoid membrane, accompanied by a 3 × 2 cm palpable nodule in the left thyroid gland. A neck US revealed a calcified heterogenic-hypoechoic solid lesion of 30 × 18 mm at the level of the hyoid bone in the submental area, which was not related to the thyroid gland. A thyroid gland US revealed several hypoechoic nodules, the largest being 38 × 24 mm, with some having micro calcifications in the left lobe of thyroid gland, while the study identified no right lobe lesions. FNAB was performed on both the midline neck mass and the left lobe nodule. The FNAB results were reported as being consistent with papillary thyroidal carcinoma for the mass along the neck midline and as benign cytology for the nodule in the left thyroid lobe. MRI of the neck showed a 30 × 20 mm midline solid soft tissue mass with hyperintense signal after injection with contrast media. The MRI also demonstrated cystic changes in the mass and evidence of invasion into the infrahyoid muscle group (). After considering all of the clinical and radiological data, despite a histopathologic diagnosis of benign cytology for the left lobe nodule, we performed a Sistrunk procedure with total thyroidectomy and central neck exploration due to suspicion of simultaneous de novo development of papillary carcinoma in the TDC and the thyroid gland. Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.\nDuring the Sistrunk procedure, a solid mass invading the infrahyoid muscle group was encountered, and gross total resection of the tumor was performed. A total thyroidectomy operation was also conducted (). During central neck exploration, samples of the suspected lymph nodes were sent for frozen section pathology, the results of which confirmed the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma metastasis. After completion of the exploration, the central neck was dissected and additional specimens were sent to pathology. Pathologic examination identified the thyroid specimen as containing papillary carcinoma of the diffuse sclerosing type and papillary carcinoma of the classical type for the TDC specimen.\nHistopathology revealed the nodule which was seen on the cut section of thyroglossal cyst tissue; the tumor was located within cysts, composed of complex branching true papillae that contain fibrovascular stalk (Figures and ). The papillae were lined by neoplastic epithelial cells with enlarged, clear “Orphan Annie eye” nuclei and some of them had nuclear grooves () that were characteristics for papillary thyroid carcinoma, classical variant. The tumor was unencapsulated with 3,5 cm in diameter. The histopathological examination of the nodule that was seen on the cut section of left lobe of thyroid gland was as follows: unencapsulated, with a 2 mm diameter of lesion being determined (). The tumor cells were composed of large, oval shaped and clear nuclei with some having a groove which was also characteristic for papillary carcinoma (). Because of the tumor size that was smaller than 1 cm in diameter and the presence of dense desmoplastic stroma, we described it as diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary microcarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry results showed that the tumor cells were positive for CK 19, Galectin-3, and HBME-1 which was compatible with papillary carcinoma (Figures , , and ).\nAfter the operation, a radioactive iodine (RAI-131) dose of 150 mCi was administered as adjuvant therapy. After RAI treatment, the patient had an undetectable thyroglobulin level at the 6-month follow-up. In addition, an I-131 whole body scan dose of 5 mCi revealed no pathologic involvement. Both a thyroglobulin level and an I-131 whole body scan were planned during follow-up at 1, 2, and 5 years after the initial RAI adjunctive therapy.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Sudden onset weakness of right upper and lower limb', 'Deviation of angle of mouth to the left side'], 'MedicalHistory': {'ComorbidIllness': 'None', 'PreviousStrokeOrTIA': 'None', 'CardiacDiseaseHistory': 'None', 'Diabetes': 'None', 'Hypertension': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT Brain', 'Finding': 'Left middle cerebral artery territory infarct measuring around 2x3 cm'}, {'Test': 'ECG', 'Finding': 'Regular narrow QRS complex long RP tachycardia at a rate of 186 bpm with inverted p waves in lead III'}, {'Test': 'Echocardiography', 'Finding': 'Normal study without structural changes or thrombus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Atrial Tachycardia', 'Type': 'Cardiac Arrhythmia', 'Location': 'Atrium'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Verapamil 40 mg three times daily orally', 'Details': 'Started on verapamil but developed sinus bradycardia, so treatment was withheld'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Did not have any other episode of arrhythmia in the following 1 week', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1 month', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No palpitations reported, ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with rate of 68 bpm'}}}"
"A 14 year-old female presented with a year's history of painless enlargement of the right parotid gland and one week's history of facial asymmetry. Physical examination revealed a firm mass 2 × 3 cm in diameter in the region of the parotid gland as well as right facial nerve paralysis. The mass was fixed with palpation as was a palpable right cervical lymph node. She had a normal body temperature and normal complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry.\nWe investigated the possibility of other diseases that could cause a swelling in the parotid gland: granulomatous infections such as mycobacterial diseases and autoimmune disorders. The results were negative.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an enlargement of the right parotid gland with evidence of multiple cystic masses involving both the superficial and deep portions of the gland.\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy was used for diagnosis. Cytopathological examination suggested ACC with the finding of large globules of the extracellular matrix, partially surrounded by basaloid tumour cells but lacking characteristic globules.\nA radical parotidectomy and modified radical neck dissection with spinal accessory nerve preservation was planned under general anesthesia. A preauricular incision that curved under the ear lobule was made in extension with the neck dissection incision. A skin subcutaneous flap was raised over the parotid until the distal branches of the facial nerve were seen to exit the gland. The mandibular, buccal, and zygomatic branches were incised and tagged with fine silk sutures for later grafting []. As the main trunk was considered to be encased by the tumour, a mastoidectomy was performed, to identify the main trunk of the facial nerve, increase the length of the proximal nerve stump for grafting, and also to provide adequate surgical margin.[] Once the main trunk was identified, extensive resection was performed to remove the parotid neoplasm. Frozen sections from the facial nerve confirm uninvolved nerve margins. After resection of the parotid neoplasm, modified neck dissection was subsequently added and the donor nerve graft was prepared from the great auricular nerve []. The greater auricular nerve was traced proximally until additional branches coming off the cervical nerve roots were isolated.[] After freshening the cable nerve graft ends as well as the proximal and distal facial nerve branches with a scalpel, microscopic epineural repair was performed with an interrupted 8-0 monofilament nylon suture, with three to five sutures used at each anastomosis. The distal part of the graft was anastomosed to the main trunk of the facial nerve and the proximal branches coming off the cervical nerve roots were anastomosed to peripheral stumps [].\nThe postoperative period was uneventful without any complications. Topical moisturizing agents were used for postoperative eye management. Gold weight placement was recommended but not accepted by the patient. Adenoid cystic carcinoma and facial nerve invasion was confirmed in the pathological examination of the surgical specimen of the parotid gland. Four weeks after surgery, the patient was irradiated with 2 Gy fractions; the total dose was 60 Gy.\nThe patient was followed every six months for two years. The House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system was utilized to assess postoperative facial nerve function.[] One year after surgery, the patient achieved facial symmetry at rest, but there was still asymmetry during mimetic motion. The patient was judged to have grade IV level of facial function. Two years after operation, the patient presented with a swelling on the left side of her neck. Physical examination revealed several palpable left cervical lymph nodes ranging from 1–2 cm in diameter in the deep jugular chain. The largest one located in the upper cervical region lying in level II was excised in another medical center. The findings of the histopathological examination were consistent with inflammatory changes; no tumour cells were detected. A CT scan of the chest at this time showed a few millimetre sized nodular lesions in the lung but there was no increase in the nodular size over two years. Hence, we did not consider these lesions as evidence of metastasis; however, follow-up was done every year. At the end of four years, the patient had slightly better facial function than at the end of the first year [].","{

"A 48 year old male presented to our emergency department with pain and restriction of movements involving both shoulders following a fall. A thorough history into the mechanism of fall revealed that the patient was a known diabetic on oral hypoglycaemic drugs and following a syncopal attack, he fell on his outstretched right hand with the body weight falling on it, causing it to dislocate posteriorly. And a bystander in trying to prevent the patient from falling held on to his left upper limb, which was pulled into abduction, extension and external rotation producing an anterior dislocation on the left side. A detailed clinical examination showed flattening of deltoid contours on both sides. Humeral head was palpable posteriorly on the right side and anteriorly on the left side. Surprisingly, there were no characteristic deformities with the arms hanging by the side of the body. Attempted range of motion was painful on both sides. Plain radiograph anteroposterior view of both shoulders showed posterior dislocation of right shoulder with a fracture of greater tuberosity and anterior dislocation of left shoulder with a greater tuberosity fracture. Special radiographs including axillary lateral and scapular Y view were taken which confirmed the findings. He was not a known epileptic and did not give any history of a seizure episode in the past. He did not have any history of dislocation in the past. There were no features suggestive of generalized ligamentous laxity.\nA closed reduction was achieved for both shoulders under general anaesthesia, anterior dislocation was reduced easily by Kochers method, and posterior was reduced by giving gentle traction on the arm in flexion and adduction, with a direct pressure to the humeral head from behind, but as the posterior dislocation was unstable, after reduction, it was immobilised by spica in slight flexion and abduction with 20 degrees external rotation, whereas a chest arm bandage was applied for the other side. Post reduction check X-ray showed concentric reduction of both shoulders with minimal displacement of fracture fragments. The spica and bandage were removed after 3 weeks and shoulder pendulum exercises were initiated. After a couple of weeks, complete range of motion exercises were started. X-ray of bilateral shoulders, at 3 months, showed complete union of the fracture. Both the shoulders have satisfactory painless range of motion with no instability.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of his details in this report.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Transient loss of consciousness while driving'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest X-ray', 'Finding': 'Large superior mediastinal shadow extending into neck'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': '7 cm × 11 cm saccular aneurysm in distal aortic arch'}, {'Test': 'Transthoracic echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Large saccular aneurysm of distal aortic arch'}, {'Test': 'MR scan', 'Finding': 'Extreme displacement of left common carotid and left subclavian arteries'}, {'Test': 'Aortogram', 'Finding': 'Displacement of left subclavian artery posteroinferiorly into left chest'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Distal aortic arch aneurysm', 'Type': 'Saccular aneurysm', 'Location': 'Between left common carotid and left subclavian arteries'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical excision and grafting', 'Details': 'Excision of aneurysm with VASCUTEK interposition graft'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uncomplicated postoperative recovery', 'DischargeStatus': 'Home on seventh postoperative day'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Four years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Fully active and asymptomatic'}}}"
"A 26-year old man accidentally had a cut from a circular saw in the medial, posterior part of the right thigh during work. Due to vascular damage of the femoral vessels he suffered substantial blood loss and when he was brought to the emergency room he was in shock but awake. The damage to the femoral artery and vein was repaired immediately and circulation of the leg and foot was restored within three hours of injury. On examination the day after surgery it was discovered that the patient had loss of sensory and motor function matching the area of the sciatic nerve below the point of injury. On the third postoperative day the area was explored and the sciatic nerve was found to be transected. After trimming of the nerve ends there was a gap of 3–4 cm. The individual tibial and peroneal groups of fascicles could be identified in the wound and by electrical stimulation of the distal nerve end. The sural nerve of the injured leg was harvested and divided into eight segments, which were then used as grafts, 5 segments for the tibial component and 3 segments for the peroneal component (Figure \n). The grafts were applied with extended knee position and fixed with single 9–0 sutures and tissue glue (Tissel®).\nThe leg was immobilized in semi flexion for four weeks. The initial rehabilitation was without complication. Follow-up was conducted at our department, every three months the first year and then every six months. The patient used an orthosis during daytime for support and to hold the foot up and physical therapy to counter contractions. Sensory re-education was performed. He later had some tendency towards plantar flexion contracture, especially in the mornings, which was treated with an orthosis during night.\nThe physical therapy aimed to encourage counter contractions in the leg. Motor function progress was measured according to the British Medical Research Council (MRC) scale showing a continuous improvement of muscle force (Table \n) At final follow up (58 months) he, above the muscle force described in Table \n, also had M4 in toe extensor muscles and even M3+ in toe flexor muscles, although more concentration was required by the patient to activate the latter muscles. Regeneration was followed with Tinel’s sign. Sensory function was examined with Semmes-Weinstein monofilament conducted by an independent occupational therapist. At 24 months follow-up he could feel the 4.56 evaluator filament (indicating diminished protective sensation) on the mid lateral part of the sole of the foot. Apart from that he only had deep pressure sensation in the foot. He had no sensation over the heel. At 40 months follow-up he could feel the 4.31 evaluator filament (diminished light touch) in the mid lateral part of the sole of the foot and under the third and fifth toe. Under the big toe and the heel he could feel the 6.65 evaluator filament (deep pressure sensation) and in the rest of the sole of the foot he could feel the 4.56 evaluator filament (diminished protective sensation). At 58 months he could feel 3.61 evaluator filament in all toes and in most of the sole of the foot, except at the heel (4.31 evaluator filament). At no point did he have problems with cold sensitivity. He had some problems with allodynia, which was treated with tramadol hydrochloride (Tramadol®) for pain relief. An electromyography (EMG) done at 41 months showed decreased nerve conduction over knee level compared to the un-injured leg. In the majority of the muscles of the lower leg denervation activity was seen, most prominent in the distal muscles. However, in the gastronemius, long peroneal and anterior tibial muscles there were good voluntary activations. A low voltage response from the abductor hallucis muscle on stimulation of the tibial nerve at the ankle indicated that there was some reinnervation of the muscles of the foot.","{

"A 40-year old female with history of breast cancer was referred from an out-side clinic. She had received a lumpectomy of her right breast with an axillary lymph node dissection 34 months before she first visited our institute. The pathology report obtained at the time of surgery documented infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and the resection margins were confirmed to be clear of carcinoma invasion. Three regional lymph nodes out of 16 were found to possess adenocarcinoma cells. Lymphovascular invasion was reported negative. Routine staging workup showed no evidence of distant metastasis, staging her as T2N1M0 based on an American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system at the time of surgery. As a surgical procedure, a catheter draining from the lumpectomy site was placed, which was later removed. She had completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluoruracil regimen, and radiotherapy of the whole breast with 50.4 Gray plus a boost of 9 Gray was performed. She denied receiving any other type of surgery. No evidence of recur were observed by thorough imaging studies; regular checkups were done at the out side clinic.\nOn her visit, she complained of a recently noticed palpable lump on her right chest wall. Physical exam revealed an approximately 2 cm sized moveable subcutaneous nodule with rubber consistency located on the middle axillary line at the level of nipple. A small scar was noticed on the skin lying directly superficial to the nodule, which the patient claimed to be the wound site of drain catheter insertion during the lumpectomy she previously received. Ultrasonography of breast and chest wall revealed a well demarcated subcutaneous mass measuring 1.8 cm in length (). No other abnormalities were demonstrated in the remaining breast. A sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy yielded infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\nA whole body bone scan and whole body positron emission tomography scan failed to demonstrate any suspected metastatic lesion other than the mentioned nodule at the right chest wall. A chest CT was obtained in addition to ultrasonography to evaluate the extent depth of the lesion, and both modalities disclosed the previously mentioned nodule to be confined to the subcutaneous compartment.\nA wide excision of the recurred mass was performed. Gross inspection of the specimen showed a block of tissue containing a subcutaneous ill-defined pinkish nodule with an expanding growth pattern measuring 1.8 cm. Histopathologic evaluation of the specimen showed clear resection margins and the tumor lesion was confined to the subcutaneous compartment. Subsequent irradiation of 50 gray at the region was performed. She is symptom free without evidence of any additional tumor recurrence, while 18 months have passed since the wide excision of the previous drain site mass has been carried out.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Worsening shortness of breath for several years', 'Chest pain after outpatient pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging test'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Spina bifida and hydrocephalus with VA shunt and subsequent VP shunt placement'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Severe pulmonic valve insufficiency due to migrated VA shunt catheter into the pulmonary artery'}, {'Test': 'Exercise stress echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Nondiagnostic for ischemia, increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure with exercise'}, {'Test': 'CT scan of the chest', 'Finding': 'Negative for pulmonary embolism, noted migrated shunt catheter in main pulmonary artery'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Pulmonic valve insufficiency', 'Type': 'Secondary to migrated VA shunt catheter', 'Location': 'Pulmonary artery'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical intracardiac catheter removal and repair of the pulmonary artery with bovine pericardial patch', 'Details': 'Majority of the catheter retrieved, portion adherent to right ventricle wall excised'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Improvement of pulmonic insufficiency', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Significant improvement in symptoms'}}}"
"A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history of lupus presented for elective left total knee arthroplasty following the development of osteoarthritis that had failed conservative measures. The patient had a history of previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system []. She underwent removal of the tibial WasherLoc approximately 10 years later, in the early 2000's ().\nThe patient was positioned supine; standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was then performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was placed and noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. At this time, it was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was then placed back on the femur and was noted to be in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The bone mulch screw was located and identified in the lateral femoral condyle; a curette was used to clear the head of the screw, and it was removed. The proximal tibia was then prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; the knee was noted to be tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. It was noted at this time while trying to trial the prostheses that the lateral femoral condyle was fractured. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted. The femoral canal was reamed, and the femoral box cut was made. However, during trialing, the medial femoral condyle was now noted to have a fracture as well. An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were then reamed to accept a 200 mm × 9 mm intramedullary nail to act as a temporary internal stabilization device (). The knee was irrigated and closed, and the patient was admitted to the floor. The patient was then brought back to the OR on postoperative day 3 following the index procedure. The prior incision was utilized; the wound was copiously irrigated. It was noted that due to the patient's poor bone quality and comminution of the fractures that the only viable option was a distal femoral replacement. The distal femur was resected, the femoral canal was reamed, and a planar was used on the distal femur. A skim cut and reaming of the tibia were performed. The components were trialed. Final implants included a 13 × 127 mm hinged femoral prosthesis and small 1-stemmed tibial tray; a 32 mm patellar component was used, and a size 10 polyethylene was then inserted; all components were cemented. The knee was noted to be stable throughout range of motion with good patellofemoral tracking. The surgical wound was copiously irrigated and closed (). Estimated blood loss was 100 mL; no postoperative transfusion was necessary. She was able to bear weight as tolerated immediately postoperatively. The patient's pain was controlled postoperatively, and she worked well with physical therapy and was discharged home with home health care on postoperative day two with 3 weeks of Coumadin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\nThe first postoperative visit was at two weeks; the patient had some swelling and quadriceps weakness, and the incision was healing well. Range of motion (ROM) was from 0-100°. At 6 weeks, she was still requiring narcotic medication; quadriceps strength was improving, ROM from 0-105°.\nAt 12 weeks, X-rays remained unchanged; the patient continued to have mild quadriceps weakness and was no longer requiring narcotic medications. ROM was not documented at this visit. At 6 months, ROM was 0-120°. The incision was well healed; X-rays were unchanged. The patient was doing well; however, she continued to have some residual quadriceps weakness and difficulty ambulating long distances. The patient was lost to follow-up after 6 months.","{

"A 60-year-old female patient was admitted to the inpatient treatment section from the outpatient therapy wing of the physical medicine and rehabilitation department for the evaluation and treatment of impaired walking due to gradual weakening of the bilateral lower extremities that had lasted for three months. The patient seemed to have cognitive impairment, and did not have accurate memory of the trauma. However, according to the report of a family member, the patient had been medicated for cerebral infarction, hypertension, and osteoporosis, with no problems in ambulation and other activities of daily living before slipping down three months ago. After that, she had been in a bed ridden state and showed gait disturbance. Based on neurological examination, her mental status was alert, but her orientation, memory, calculation and other cerebral functions were generally impaired, whereas her speech was intact. In terms of the cerebellar function, there were no specific findings on both of the upper extremities, and the lower extremities could not be checked due to muscle weakness. Although an accurate evaluation of motor function was challenging during the manual muscle test, the upper extremities were found to be in normal range. For the lower extremities, the flexor and extensor of the hip and knee of both sides were in poor grade, and the dorsiflexor and plantarflexor of both ankle joints were degraded to trace grade level. There was no limitation in passive range of motion. In both lower extremities, the spasticity corresponded to the Modified Ashworth Scale I grade. Although accurate evaluation for sensory function was also difficult, the patient showed a relatively intact result in the pinprick test, but the proprioception and vibration sensation were impaired. Deep tendon reflex was normal for both upper extremities but increased in both lower extremities, and Barbinski's signs and ankle clonus were found on both sides. Results of the functional evaluation showed impossibility of independent ambulation. Although the activities of daily living using the upper extremities were possible, the patient needed considerable assistance in other areas. In terms of urinary function, urinary retention was observed, so we inserted a foley catheter since the patient was incapable of self-voiding. In addition, due to severe constipation, medication was provided and we helped defection with the use of glycerine enema, 2-3 per day as needed. The first lumbar vertebral body bursting fracture was found in the simple film taken at admission. From the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, the spinal dural arteriovenous fistula was found in the first lumbar vertebral body bursting fracture in addition to the shades of dilated vein in the periphery of the spines starting from the fifth thoracic vertebra to the cornus medullaris. As a result, the spinal cord edema was accompanied, and the specific findings of high signal, light shade of the spine were observed from the T2 weighted image (). Although electromyography and somatosensory evoked potential test were considered, we could not conduct them because of the patient's transfer to the neurosurgical department due to urgent need of arterial embolization. For more accurate location mapping of the spinal arteriovenous fistula, we conducted spinal vessel angiography and found that the arteriovenous fistula originated from the twelfth intercostal artery and first lumbar radicular artery. In addition, the spinal vein located on the anterior and posterior spine that continued to the cervical vertebra region was observed (). Since the artery of interest was not that large, we planned the embolization procedure employing glue (n-butyl cyanoacrylate) rather than the operation. After embolization of the number twelve right thoracic vertebrate intercostal artery and first lumber, the embolization of all fistula was followed. As a result, there was no venous plexus observed around the spine (), and the neurologic symptoms of the patient improved. The hip flexor and knee extensor improved to 'fair grade' and the ankle plantar flexor improved to 'poor grade'. Although we were not able to check the sensory function due to the patient's impaired cognition, big changes were not observed after the treatment. As a result of the post therapy follow-up using MRI to see the condition of spinal cord edema, we found that the spinal vein was dilated due to arteriovenous fistula not being found, as well as the spinal cord edema around the artery. Therefore, we were able to observe normal low signal intensity of the spinal cord from the T2 weighted image (). With the help of rehabilitation therapy including strengthening and endurance exercise of the lower extremities, gait training, and functional electrical stimulation to both tibialis anterior, the patient showed gradual improvement and could ambulate about 2-3 m. The urinary symptoms also improved and the patient was able to self-void after removal of the foley catheter following normal functioning results based on the urodynamic study. Bowel function also improved and the patient was capable of daily defecation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chronic back pain', 'Overdose of diazepam and methadone after an argument with husband'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PsychiatricHistory': 'Depression', 'PreviousADR': {'Drug': 'Diazepam', 'Severity': 'Overdose'}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT head', 'Findings': 'Diffuse hypointensity throughout subcortical white matter, diffusely hyperintense on FLAIR and T2 sequences'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Findings': 'Confluent change throughout white matter, sparing cerebellar white matter, no alteration of white matter tracts in internal capsule and brain stem'}, {'Test': 'MR spectroscopy', 'Findings': 'Elevated choline and creatinine peaks, small peak for lactic acid'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Benzodiazepine toxicity', 'Type': 'Toxicity', 'Location': 'Brain'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Flumazenil administration', 'Details': 'Administered 1.0 mg flumazenil in 0.2 mg increments every 30 seconds during EEG monitoring'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Modest clinical improvement in mental status observed', 'DischargeStatus': 'Substantial improvement both clinically and radiographically upon follow-up'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1 year', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Normal mental status and brain imaging'}}}"
"A 59-year-old female patient reported to the hospital for replacement of missing teeth. On examination, the patient had lost all her teeth and her one side of the face was paralyzed. The patient gave a history of trauma before some years and gradually lost all her teeth due to periodontal problems. The patient underwent medical treatment for the same in a general hospital. The paralysis was noted both in upper and lower regions of the face and the patient was unable to smile and close her eyes on her left side. The patient was unable to lift her left eyebrow and complained of reduced taste sensation, but was not insisting on the symptoms. The patient had spasms in her facial muscles with synkinesis, which developed gradually [Figures and ] and was not clear of the time period over which it developed. There was an asymmetry of her face when she tried to smile or close her eyes with a maximal effort. The diagnosis was Bell's palsy Grade IV[] on the left side of the patient's face which involved the ipsilateral part of the facial nerve. The patient was not willing for the invasive treatment for the same. The patient was given an option of complete dentures with cheek plumpers,[] which can somewhat improve her facial appearance. The patient readily accepted the treatment plan and primary impressions were made for the upper and lower edentulous arches.\nThe diagnostic casts showed normal arch form without any pathologic conditions. The labial and buccal flanges of the dentures were planned to be enhanced as the circumoral muscles were weak. A simple way of enhancing the labial flanges with wax and later processing with acrylic resin was planned due to time and economic factors. Proper physiologic impressions were made after explaining the treatment plan to the patient with her consent. The occlusal rims were fabricated from the master casts with additional wax on the labial and buccal flanges. The jaw relations were made and try-in verification was done at a later date. Wax was added more on the right side and less on her left side to reproduce the symmetry of her face [Figures –]. After satisfactory results with the patient's consent, the denture was fabricated with high impact acrylic resin. The upper and lower dentures were inserted in a later appointment [Figures and ]. The patient was taught to use the prosthesis and proper instructions were given to the patient. Oral hygiene was emphasized to avoid food entrapment between the dentures and the cheek. The patient was further referred to an ophthalmologist for corneal protection.","{

"A 78 year-old male was diagnosed with central non-small cell lung cancer 12 months earlier. The primary lung cancer was located in the proximal right upper lobar bronchus associated with postobstuctive atelectasis of the right upper lobe. However, at the time of diagnosis, the patient refused all the curative means. He had exhibited cough and increasing blood tinged sputum in the previous 4 months. We performed CT imaging on outpatient clinics, which showed a completely obstructed right upper lobar bronchus by a tumor with postobstructive pneumonia of the right upper lobe. The wall of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius was thickened and the lumen of the right main bronchus was almost narrowed by tumor infiltrations. Metastatic lymphadenopathy was observed in the right lower paratracheal and subcarinal area (). Nine days after the CT scan, the patient was hospitalized and underwent bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopic examination demonstrated that orifice of the right main bronchus was nearly completely obstructed by the endoluminal mass and there was diffuse bleeding from the right main bronchus. The patient received urgent external beam radiotherapy to control bleeding from the friable endobronchial tumor and bleeding gradually decreased for several days. However, eleven days after the radiation therapy, a sudden onset of dyspnea developed. Chest radiography showed that the right lung had totally collapsed and bronchoscopic examination revealed complete obstruction of the right main bronchus with diffuse bleeding.\nBronchial artery embolization could not be considered as a treatment option for hemoptysis because bleeding conditions were not because of active arterial bleeding and there was no prominent contrast enhancement of the mass as seen on the CT scan. We decided that bronchial stent insertion in the right main bronchus was necessary to both, re-open the airway and to control the bleeding of tumor through the tamponade effect. After the bronchogram, which was performed to identify the airway on a fluoroscopic image, we decided to sacrifice superior segment of the right lower bronchus to preserve basal segments of the right lower lobe. The 12 mm - 4.3 cm self-expanding silicone-covered nitinol stent (Hercules airway stent, S & G Biotech, Seongnam, Korea) was deployed in the right lower lobar bronchus to the right main bronchus. However, proximal portion of the right main bronchus was not completely covered due to its insufficient length. For this reason, another 12 mm - 5.3 cm self-expanding silicone-covered nitinol stent was reinserted, overlapping the first stent.\nAt the end of the procedure, an immediate improvement in the aeration of the right basal lung was observed on fluoroscopy and hemoptysis was subsided (). Nevertheless, the patient died two days later due to lack of expectoration that resulted in whole lung aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Generalized epileptic seizures', 'Muscular weakness in both upper and lower limbs', 'Gait instability', 'Headache'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Right hip surgery after a traffic accident'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Brain CT scan', 'Finding': 'Lesion in right parietal-occipital lobe, dimensions of 7.5 × 2 × 4.6 cm, heterogeneous contrast uptake'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Lesion in right occipital lobe, compatible with low grade glioma, subtotal excision confirmed post-surgery'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Right occipital lobe'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical resection', 'Details': 'Occipital craniotomy for biopsy, followed by surgical excision using microscope and CUSA'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Tumor-free after treatment with radiotherapy and methotrexate'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '16 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient is tumor-free and recovering well'}}}"
"A 78-year-old man with a history of severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) requiring left third toe amputation and percutaneous stenting of the left superficial femoral artery was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) which occurred after a fall. The patient was also found to have an acute fracture in the tenth thoracic vertebra, and he subsequently underwent spinal fusion of the eighth to twelfth thoracic vertebrae. Within three hours postoperation, the patient was still lethargic and did not complain of pain; however, his left lower extremity was noted to be swollen and cool to the touch from the thigh down with a mottled skin appearance (). Pedal pulses were completely absent on palpation, and no signal was detected on a portable Doppler device. The initial suspicion was for an arterial embolic event causing limb ischemia as the patient had a history of atrial fibrillation. As a result, a computed tomography arteriography (CTA) of the abdominal aorta with bilateral runoff was done and showed the previously placed stent extending from the left superficial femoral artery to the proximal popliteal artery with absent filling consistent with vascular occlusion (). Due to significant leg swelling, a venous duplex ultrasound was done and revealed extensive acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ranging from the left common femoral vein down to the popliteal vein with completely absent venous blood flow. The clinical and radiographic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD).\nAfter clearance from the neurosurgeon, IV heparin was started approximately 7 hours after the development of symptoms. Due to the extensive DVT and the advanced PAD, the vascular surgery team deemed that the chances of limb salvage are very small and that any procedural intervention will pose a great risk to the patient's life. Thrombolysis was contraindicated due to the recent SAH and spinal surgery. After comprehensive multidisciplinary discussions including a second expert opinion which was sought from a peripheral interventional cardiologist, a delayed decision was reached to attempt a minimally invasive percutaneous limb-salvaging approach which occurred 20 hours after the diagnosis was established. In the catheterization lab, venography of the inferior vena cava (IVC) via left popliteal vein access revealed extensive and occlusive thrombosis of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins (). The IVC was patent. Doppler ultrasound confirmed the absence of blood flow in the popliteal artery. Under ultrasound guidance, the left popliteal vein was accessed, and the ClotTriever (Inari Medical) sheath was placed. The ClotTriever thrombectomy catheter was then introduced, and six device passes were made extending from the iliac vein back into the popliteal vein with extraction of a significant amount of thrombus (). An intravascular ultrasound detected compression strictures of the common iliac and femoral veins (), and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed (). Immediate postintervention venography revealed restoration of the venous flow (), and ultrasound Doppler detected a strong popliteal arterial flow. Sixteen hours postintervention, the leg swelling and discoloration almost completely resolved (). At 1-month follow-up, the left leg had completely returned to baseline appearance without any evidence of edema or discoloration (). No amputation was needed. The patient reported in this article has provided consent to publish their case details and images.","{

"A 33-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on December 21th, 2009 with recurrent dyskinesia episodes. He had not had any problems during the perinatal period, but after his first birthday, his limbs had twisted intermittently. Symptoms occurred on either the right or left side limbs, starting from the leg to the arm, and occasionally occurred in the arm and leg simultaneously, or were only experienced on the arm or leg. The symptoms lasted from hours to days. He reported having frequent symptoms that were more than four times per week, and for almost every instance he reported crying. He was unable to move during the hemiplegic episodes and also had a history of convulsions that had occurred several times before starting elementary school. Without the episodes, his developmental milestones were normal in the childhood.\nAfter he entered an elementary school, hemiplegic events recurred if he was nervous or encountered a new environment although it was not provoked by his crying anymore. Symptoms occurred on alternating sides and occasionally in all four extremities. However, once the symptoms presented on one side, the symptoms did not progress to the other side. His symptoms still lasted hours to days and recurred several times a week. Because of these frequent episodes, he could not complete the elementary school although he did not have mental retardation. However, he had not had growth or cognitive abnormality until he became an adult.\nBefore visiting our outpatient clinic, he reported that the symptoms manifested once a month, and lasted for three days to two weeks. The characteristics of the episodes were similar to the episodes during his elementary school age. When the attacks were not present, he could live normally and did not have cognitive dysfunction. He did not have any loss of consciousness during the attack. The family history revealed that his cousin was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and died in her twenties.\nAn initial neurological examination revealed motor weakness (motor power on upper and lower extremities: Medical Research Council grade IV- and III, respectively) and dystonia on the right side and peripheral type facial palsy (). There was no hearing loss or ataxic features, and other examination findings were normal. His mini-mental status exam score was 24/30 (−1 point in memory recall, −4 in attention and calculation, and −1 in interlocking pentagon drawing). In addition, the pes planovalgus deformity was identified in his feet ().\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebellar atrophy () without any vascular lesions. There was no abnormal finding on Tc-99m-hexamethylpropylenamineoxime single photon emission computed tomography () during the hemiplegic attack on the right side. In addition, the result of the 24-hour video electroencephalogram monitoring during the hemiplegic attack was also normal. We tried quetiapine 50 mg per day and methazolamide 50 mg twice per day for symptomatic treatment, but they were not effective.\nWhole exome sequencing was conducted in August 2017, which revealed a heterozygous G947R variant in the ATP1A3 gene (c.2839G > C, read depth = 54; rs398122887), which is a known pathologic variant. The patient was treated with 5 mg of flunarizine three times per day, but this treatment was not effective and the patient discontinued because of dizziness.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. 1601-048-733). A waiver of documentation of informed consent for the genetic analysis was granted as the requirements were satisfied. The informed consent for the figures and reports were obtained from the patient.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Plasmacytoma enucleated from the medial side of the left mandible 3 years ago'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT Scan', 'Finding': '3 × 2 cm diameter defect between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Orocotaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Complication', 'Location': 'Medial side of the left mandible'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Submandibular gland pedicled flap', 'Details': 'Excision of fistula, mobilization and rotation of submandibular gland, closure of oral and cutaneous flaps'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Ideal closure of the fistula observed'}}}"

The patient had a past anesthetic history of spinal anesthesia for a cesarean section twenty years before the time of presentation. The patient history was otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination was only remarkable for uncontrolled blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg which was attributed to poor compliance with antihypertensive therapy. Her abdominal ultrasound was only significant for cholelithiasis. The patient was advised for better compliance to antihypertensive therapy and another anesthesia clinic visit was scheduled. The patient was seen again in the anesthesia clinic three months later. Her blood pressure at that time was found to be 150/80 mmHg, and the remainder of her examination was normal. Screening echocardiography recommended by the treating physician two months before that visit showed normal ejection fraction (66%) and mild tricuspid regurgitation in an otherwise normal study. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed before the anesthesia clinic visit and was normal (). The patient was scheduled for surgery and admitted for the operation on the following day. Preoperatively, she was assessed by the anesthesia team in the hospital on the morning of the operation and her blood pressure was found to be 180/110 mmHg, which was again attributed to poor compliance with medication regimen. As the operation was scheduled on elective basis, it was therefore postponed until a tighter control of blood pressure could be achieved and the patient was discharged. She was seen four weeks later in the anesthesia clinic; there were no new complaints and there was no change in her examination except for her blood pressure, which was controlled, being 140/80 mmHg after proper compliance to her medication regimen. She was deemed fit for surgery, readmitted to the hospital, and scheduled for the operation as an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification-2 (ASA-2) on the following day.\nAfter admission, the patient's blood pressure was continuously monitored. Her routine labs, including blood electrolyte, were within normal limits. Premedication with 15 milligrams of oral midazolam was administered in two divided doses, once at bedtime and the second dose one hour before transfer to the operation theatre. On arrival to the theatre, her blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were 130/80 mmHg and 82 beats per minute (bpm), respectively, and her peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 100%. The patient had a 20-gauge cannula fixed in the surgical ward; another 18-gauge cannula was fixed in the operation theatre before induction. Intravenous infusion of lactated ringer was started; a total of around 350 ml of lactated ringer was transfused before induction. Standard monitoring of HR, BP, SpO2, and ETCO2 was connected. Invasive blood pressure monitoring and bispectral index monitoring were not connected as they are not part of the routine monitoring in the institution. Induction of general anesthesia was achieved using an intravenous injection of 150 milligrams of propofol and 10 micrograms of sufentanyl. Muscle relaxation was achieved using 8 milligrams of intravenous cisatracurium. The patient was intubated using a size 7 endotracheal tube; she was then connected to mechanical ventilation using volume control mode with a tidal volume of 450 ml, respiratory rate of 12 per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mmHg. End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) was maintained at about 38 mmHg and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was maintained at 15 centimeters of water (cmH2O). Anesthesia was maintained with 45% oxygen mixture with air and inhalation of 6% desflurane. Almost ten to twelve minutes after induction and preparation, the surgical team proceeded with Veress needle insertion and peritoneal insufflation. Insufflation was performed using carbon dioxide (CO2) at a flow rate of 40 liters per minute (L/M) to achieve an intraperitoneal pressure of 20 mmHg. Immediately after starting peritoneal insufflation, the patient developed sinus bradycardia and her heart rate started to drop reaching 35 to 40 bpm within a few seconds; however, there was no change in her ETCO2 or SpO2. The anesthetist immediately instructed the surgeon to stop the insufflation and deflate the abdomen. Intravenous injection of atropine (1 mg), which was prepared preoperatively, was given immediately and flushed with intravenous saline. Blood pressure reading obtained at the time did not show change in blood pressure. While the atropine was being administered, the patient's heart rate continued to drop, reaching 10–15 bpm, while her ETCO2 did not change. It was then decided that the patient would progress into cardiac arrest, so the anesthetist called for help of senior anesthesia staff to be present in the operating room and ordered the assistant staff to prepare intravenous adrenaline. The anesthetist then could not palpate the patient's pulse, so cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. The anesthetist started chest compressions and an injection of adrenaline (100 micrograms) was given intravenously. The patient's pulse was restored within 30 seconds as sinus tachycardia of 124 bpm. Her blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg, SpO2 was 99%, and ETCO2 was 32 mmHg. An arterial line was then fixed under ultrasound guidance to monitor blood pressure, and blood samples were taken to check for blood electrolytes, gases levels, and cardiac markers, including troponin and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). During the following 15 minutes, the patient's vitals were closely monitored as the case was being discussed between the seniors of the surgical and anesthesia teams. During that time, the results of the blood gases and electrolytes came back and were within normal limits; in addition, there were no changes in the patient's ECG, except for sinus tachycardia that gradually returned to normal sinus rhythm. It was noted by the team that the insufflation flow rate had been high, and it was assumed that this was the cause of the event.\nAfter being reassured that the patient was vitally stable and that there were no signs of cardiac or metabolic insult, the case was deemed fit to proceed for surgery. The surgical team started the operation again approximately 30 minutes after the bradycardia event. Another two milligrams of cisatracurium was administered, and a total of around 750 ml of lactated ringer was transfused by that time. The second time, peritoneal insufflation was performed using CO2 at a flow rate of 8 liters per minute (L/M) to achieve intraperitoneal pressure of 12 mmHg; pneumoperitoneum was achieved without complications. The patient was positioned in the reverse Trendelenburg left tilt position and the surgery was completed uneventfully within 20 minutes. The abdomen was deflated with the patient in the supine position. Intravenous injection of 5 milligrams of morphine was given and then the patient was extubated smoothly and shifted to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). In the PACU, the patient was kept in the semi-sitting position and her vital signs and conscious level were closely observed. She was assessed for any postoperative pain or any new complains, and 1 gram of acetaminophen was given for pain control. The result for the confirmatory cardiac marker levels came back by that time and was within normal limits.\nThe patient was discharged from the PACU to the surgical ward after around 30 minutes with an Aldrete score of 10. Follow-up ECG () was performed and troponin levels were examined postoperatively in the surgical ward, both were within normal limits. The patient was seen in the surgical ward postoperatively by the anesthesia team after being discharged and then in the evening and then again on the next morning; on all occasions, she was vitally stable and fully conscious, with no complains. The patient was assessed by a cardiologist before discharge and was deemed free from cardiovascular problems. The patient was counselled about the intraoperative events by the surgical and anesthesia teams and was discharged on her postoperative day 3. She was scheduled for a routine follow-up visit to the surgical outpatient clinic one week following discharge. She was seen in the outpatient clinic after one week and was stable vitally and had no complains.","{

"This is a case of a 27-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history significant for ALL who was brought into the ED by the EMS after an episode of cardiac arrest.\nThe patient's history starts when he was 5 years of age when he was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. He underwent chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and steroids at the time of diagnosis. At the end of two years, it was diagnosed that his ALL has progressed to involve the central nervous system and he was given chemotherapy for an additional two years which also included methotrexate. During this time the patient had complaints of constipation and after two weeks of no bowel movements, the patient was found straining in the toilet when he clenched his chest due to pain and fainted. He was taken to the hospital where he had a blood work and echocardiogram which were unremarkable. The patient recovered completely with no further similar episodes in his childhood. It is unclear whether the patient had an acute coronary syndrome or any arrythmias at that time. The patient eventually lost follow-up with his primary care doctor. There is no other past medical history and no positive family history for cardiac diseases. The patient also denied smoking, drinking of alcohol, and illicit drug use which was confirmed with the patient later.\nOn the day of admission, the patient was performing his usual duties in his workplace which included lifting of heavy objects. When the patient was walking after his work, he suddenly collapsed down on the floor. His friend who was present at the side witnessed this event. There was no breathing or palpable pulse. CPR was started and the paddles of the AED were connected which showed a shockable rhythm. The patient was shocked for four times and chest compression was given in between. When the patient was brought to the emergency department of the hospital he had an EKG () which showed normal sinus rhythm, Q waves in the inferior wall leads concerning old myocardial infarction versus a direct damage to the RCA territory myocardium due to chemotherapy effect. His vitals at the time of admission were blood pressure 86/47, heart rate 88, and respiratory rate 16 and he was afebrile. His labs were unremarkable with negative troponins. He was unresponsive at this time and his lungs and heart were clear to auscultation. He was intubated in the emergency department for airway protection and the patient was immediately admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.\nEventually the patient got stabilized and was extubated. He had an echocardiogram which showed a LVEF of 36.9%, large basal and mid inferior aneurysm, akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral wall, moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, and trace mitral regurgitation. He had a left and right cardiac catheterization along with left ventriculography (Figures , , and ) which showed no evidence of disease in his left main, left anterior descending, and right coronary artery and left circumflex. His left ventriculography showed a normal sized ventricle, LVEF of 35 to 40%, and a large inferior wall aneurysm with the inferior base and midportion being akinetic. After the cardiac catheterization, the patient was transferred to a tertiary medical center for further care and he eventually received an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator with no surgical intervention and was managed medically with beta blocker and ACE inhibitor. Six months later after this event, the patient has been doing well with no further episodes of arrhythmias and has improved EF.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting in right proximal third clavicle fracture and displaced femoral shaft fracture'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Comorbidities': 'None', 'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiographic analysis', 'Finding': 'Right proximal third clavicle fracture with inferior displacement and pneumothorax'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Fractured clavicle penetrating pleural cavity and causing partial lung collapse'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Clavicle fracture with pneumothorax', 'Type': 'Orthopedic', 'Location': 'Right proximal third clavicle'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Open reduction with internal fixation', 'Details': 'Surgery performed to stabilize clavicle fracture with locking plate and screws'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on 3rd postoperative day'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Regained full range of motion, no pulmonary symptoms'}}}"
"A 55-year-old edentulous denture wearer female reported with the chief complaints of burning sensation in the oral cavity especially in anterior portion of mouth, frequent redness of mucosa, inability to sense temperature changes of food, and recurrent allergic and microbial infections with present acrylic dentures. Medical history revealed that the patient was undergoing treatment under a gynecologist for menopausal symptoms. Dental history revealed patient was edentulous since 2 years and had been experiencing above problems since 1 year.\nSo it was decided to fabricate a complete denture with a customized metal palate design that along with the ongoing treatment from gynecologist would relieve the patient from symptoms because contact sensitivity to denture base materials or to allergens and microbial antigens on the acrylic denture plate plays a greater role in burning sensation in edentulous persons.[]\nThe customized metal palate, apart from fulfilling the patient's needs, was designed in an innovative way with metal loops in specific directions and positions that would enhance interlocking with acrylic portion and also not to interfere with the teeth arrangement of artificial teeth.\nThe primary impression was made with irreversible hydrocolloid. Custom tray was fabricated and secondary impression was made with zinc oxide eugenol. The final cast derived from this impression was duplicated and refractory cast was formed. The refractory cast is used for the fabrication of the customized metal palate.\nA sheet of green spacer wax was adapted on the palatal portion of the cast covering the crest of the ridge and extending 2-3 mm beyond it. Loops of 2-3 mm length made of wax were attached to the peripheral border of the previously adapted palatal spacer wax. It was taken care that all these loops were 2-3 mm short of the sulcus as shown by straight arrow []. These loops would enhance the interlocking of acrylic. This was important because no loop should interfere with the acrylic border of the denture extending into the sulcus.\nTiny loops were placed slightly palatal to the crest as shown by the curved arrow []. The height of these loops was such that it would not interfere with the arrangement of artificial teeth but was sufficient enough for inflow of acrylic resin. A butt joint was created palatal to the crest at the junction of acrylic and metal that enhances the strength of the metal acrylic junction creates a smooth joining of acrylic with metal avoiding any step formation, thus making it comfortable for the patient.\nFor making the butt joint, a 2-mm cylindrical blue wax beading was adapted palatal to the crest of the ridge as shown by straight arrow []. A bard parker knife was run 45° to the border of the bead. Once the design of the palate in wax was done, wax sprues were attached and casting was done. The metal palate after finishing was placed now on the master cast [] and maxillary rim was made for jaw relations []. The jaw relations were recorded and teeth arrangement was done. After curing, the maxillary metal denture was finished and polished []. The patient's pre-treatment [] and post-treatment [] photographs showed marked improvement in esthetics. After 3-month follow-up, patient reported drastic improvement in symptoms previously mentioned.","{

"A male patient aged 49 years with no previous medical history presented with neck pain from a foreign object. The patient was accidentally struck by a projectile from a nail gun on a construction site. The patient complained of pain along the left side of the neck and inability to swallow. On initial evaluation, patient was neurologically intact with absent Horner's syndrome. There were no signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic instability. The head of the nail was visible behind and above the angle of the mandible at the level of the skin - neck zone 3 (Figure , Table )\nThe point of the nail was not visible in the oral cavity but was palpable along the oral mucosa along the left side of the oropharynx. The patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection without complications in an outlying emergency room (ER) and triaged to the local Level One trauma center for further management. Upon arrival to our trauma center, a computed tomography (CT) angiography of the neck was obtained which demonstrated the nail traversing in very close proximity to the left internal carotid artery close to the skull base with preserved flow proximal and distal to the nail. There was no active contrast extravasation or definitive presence of a pseudoaneurysm although the evaluation was limited by the beam-hardening artifact from the nail (Figure ).\nThe patient was emergently transported to the interventional radiology suite to determine the status of the left carotid artery and possible endovascular repair. Left common carotid angiography in the neck demonstrated preserved flow through the left internal carotid artery but significant vessel narrowing at the level of the nail (Figure ).\nFurther investigation with three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography demonstrated small areas of contrast stagnation proximal and distal to the nail with a small dissection flap proximal to the nail, consistent with at least a partial vessel injury (Figure ).\nThe intracranial left anterior circulation imaged normally without abnormal vessel dropout. Upon discussion among trauma surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery and neurointerventional teams, the decision was made to proceed with endovascular repair in conjunction with nail removal. The patient was given 600 mg of clopidogrel and 325 mg of aspirin via orogastric tube and was heparinized to an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250. The short 6F sheath was exchanged for 6F Terumo Destination sheath (Terumo Medical, Somerset, New Jersey, USA) and positioned in the distal left common carotid artery. The injury site was crossed with a Synchro-2 0.014 microwire (Stryker, Fremont, California, USA) under the fluoroscopic roadmap. A 5 x 25 mm Gore Viabahn covered stent (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) was positioned across the level of injury. The nail was removed by gentle traction by trauma surgery with the simultaneous deployment of the Gore Viabahn covered stent into the left internal carotid artery spanning the injured segment. Follow-up angiography demonstrated excellent flow through the stent but with active extravasation secondary to a proximal endoleak related to incomplete apposition of the proximal stent to the vessel wall (Figure ).\nAt this time, the anaesthesia team noted blood pooling in the oropharynx. We introduced a 5 x 30 mm Aviator Plus balloon (Cordis, Milpitas, California, USA) and performed angioplasty of the proximal end of the stent. Follow-up angiography demonstrated no active extravasation and excellent flow through the stent (Figure ).\nCerebral angiography demonstrated no abnormal vessel dropout in the left anterior circulation. There was no further bleeding in the oropharynx or through the tract. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.\nOn a postoperative day one, the patient was extubated without incident. No neurological deficits were noted. The patient was continued on 325 mg of Aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily. The patient was cleared for an oral diet. Follow-up CT angiogram demonstrated patency of the left internal carotid stent and no pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure ). The patient did receive tetanus boosters and antibiotics as part of the initial management to prevent secondary infection. The patient was discharged to home on hospital day five. We planned to follow up the patient with CT angiogram at six weeks after the procedure. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain the imaging as the patient was out of state and was uninsured. Per phone conversation the patient was doing very well and did not report any symptoms consistent with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) at two months after the procedure. The patient stopped his clopidogrel one week after the procedure due to financial reasons but continues on the aspirin regimen.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Non-healing ulcer over the medial aspect of lower 1/3rd of right leg for the past year'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': {'Description': 'Received a locking distal tibial plate along with distal fibular plate 3 years ago from UAE', 'Outcome': 'Implant removal attempted at another hospital six months ago, unsuccessful'}, 'Diagnosis': {'DiabetesType': 'Type 2', 'Duration': 'Diagnosed 5 years back'}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Physical Examination', 'Finding': 'Non-healing ulcer over the medial aspect of lower 1/3rd of right leg'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Non-healing ulcer', 'Location': 'Medial aspect of lower 1/3rd of right leg'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Implant Removal', 'Details': ""New technique named as Rohit's technique for removal of stripped headed/jammed interlocking screws""}, 'PostoperativeCourse': {'Recovery': 'Successful removal of remaining 4 proximal screws using the new technique', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable'}}}"
"A 14-year-old girl, accompanied by his father, presented to a university primary care clinic with a complaint of intolerable low back pain after two recent falls. On further history taking, she had been experiencing a chronic back pain for the last 2 years. She described her initial pain to be acute in onset, occurring at the lower back because of prolonged sitting on the floor, after which she had an ongoing chronic low back pain. In her current boarding school training, children were accustomed to be sitting on the floor for many hours to learn the Koran.\nShe could perform her daily activities but distanced herself from any sports. Having developed increasing pain in her back, she requested her father to take her to a general practitioner (GP), which required her to be excused from school activities. Hence, her father became suspicious of her real intention and attributed her complaint of pain to the secondary intention of wanting to be away from school. Her father, who had a strong character, dominated the consultation and tried to convince the physician to the idea that his daughter feigned the back pain as an excuse to be away from school.\nOver the last 24 months, she had visited multiple GP clinics. Her recurrent clinic visits were initially driven by symptoms of low back pain, sciatica, and later, lower limb numbness and weakness. The latter was noticeable 21 months after the first clinic visit. On recalling her history, she revealed four crucial time points at which she sought medical help for symptom progression. Most of the time, she was attended by different physicians during her clinic visits. The GP whom she visited several times gathered information on her history mainly from her father, who downrated and attributed her symptoms to prolonged sitting with lack of stretching.\nHer first clinic visit was at 12 years of age for a complaint of intermittent low back pain without neurological deficit. A diagnosis of nonspecific low back pain was made, and a paracetamol with topical ointments was prescribed.\nApproximately 18 months later, at the age of 13 years, she started to experiencing persistent low back pain, for which she visited the GP’s clinic on a monthly basis. The pain started to radiate to the right lower leg on walking. At that time, she could still maintain her schooling and other activities of daily living. Her symptoms were treated conservatively as muscular pain and sciatica. No radiological imaging was ordered at that time. Continuous analgesia, topical ointment, and multi-vitamins were prescribed by different GPs.\nThree months later, she started to develop persistent weakness and numbness on her right lower limb, especially on sitting. This was worsened by lifting objects and ambulation. A diagnosis of sciatica was consistently made by her physicians. Management of her condition remained conservative with regular analgesia and back care. In addition, multiple medical leave certificates were issued, which her father disliked.\nThree months later, when she was 14 years old, she visited our primary care center with a severe low back pain triggered by two incidents of fall in the bathroom. The pain disturbed her sleep, and her right lower limb weakness and numbness worsened. She was unable to ambulate well. On examination, she walked with antalgic gain due to pain. No spinal tenderness was elicited upon palpation, but paraspinal muscle stiffness was observed. Her lumbar spine range of motion was restricted at 45° on forward flexion. Straight leg raising was up to 45° bilaterally, with evidence of nerve root tension. Sacroiliac and hip joint dysfunction test results were negative. A neurological examination of her lower limbs revealed a depressed deep tendon reflex in both knees. Her muscle strength was graded 4/5 on hip flexion, knee flexion, and extension, but was slightly weaker on the right side. Her tone was normal bilaterally. She felt patchy reduced sensation to light and sharp touches in the right lower limb at L2 to L5 dermatomes. No saddle paresthesia was observed. A lumbosacral radiograph showed loss of normal lumbar lordosis.\nOur primary care center, located within a university-based hospital, provides an added advantage of direct access to advanced radiological services. We liaised with the radiologist who suggested performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine urgently. Upon detection of the spinal lesion, a contrast medium was administered during the MRI. An immediate report revealed an enhancing spinal mass in the region of the conus medullaris, which suggested an ependymoma as shown in and .\nSubsequently, she underwent L1 to L3 laminectomy and gross tumor excision. Histopathological examination (HPE) of the spinal mass showed features consistent with ependymoma WHO grade II as shown in . After the surgery, her right-sided lower limb weakness improved tremendously. However, she developed bladder and bowel dysfunctions, which are possible complications of any spinal cord surgery. Assessment by a rehabilitation specialist revealed a significant neurogenic bladder on the basis of the failed trial without a catheter. Further evaluation using single-channel cystometry revealed detrusor acontractility with high residual volume. The 4-hourly, clean, intermittent, self-catheterization residual volume was >20%. A bowel assessment revealed an upper motor neuron type of neurogenic bowel. Five months after the surgery, her neurogenic bladder and bowel remained. She needed regular rectal enema with manual evacuation to empty her bowel. Moreover, she needed to perform 4-hourly intermittent self-catheterization to empty her urinary bladder. While her right lower limb and saddle paresthesia only gradually improved, her lower limb weakness completely resolved.\nThe patient provided written informed consent for the publication of clinical details and images.","{

The nail was removed by gentle traction by trauma surgery with the simultaneous deployment of the Gore Viabahn covered stent into the left internal carotid artery spanning the injured segment. Follow-up angiography demonstrated excellent flow through the stent but with active extravasation secondary to a proximal endoleak related to incomplete apposition of the proximal stent to the vessel wall (Figure ).\nAt this time, the anaesthesia team noted blood pooling in the oropharynx. We introduced a 5 x 30 mm Aviator Plus balloon (Cordis, Milpitas, California, USA) and performed angioplasty of the proximal end of the stent. Follow-up angiography demonstrated no active extravasation and excellent flow through the stent (Figure ).\nCerebral angiography demonstrated no abnormal vessel dropout in the left anterior circulation. There was no further bleeding in the oropharynx or through the tract. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.\nOn a postoperative day one, the patient was extubated without incident. No neurological deficits were noted. The patient was continued on 325 mg of Aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily. The patient was cleared for an oral diet. Follow-up CT angiogram demonstrated patency of the left internal carotid stent and no pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure ). The patient did receive tetanus boosters and antibiotics as part of the initial management to prevent secondary infection. The patient was discharged to home on hospital day five. We planned to follow up the patient with CT angiogram at six weeks after the procedure. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain the imaging as the patient was out of state and was uninsured. Per phone conversation the patient was doing very well and did not report any symptoms consistent with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) at two months after the procedure. The patient stopped his clopidogrel one week after the procedure due to financial reasons but continues on the aspirin regimen.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Scheduled for off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery', 'History of diabetes mellitus with neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy'], 'MedicalHistory': {'DiagnosedConditions': ['Diabetes mellitus', 'Neuropathy', 'Nephropathy', 'Retinopathy']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Pre-operative echocardiogram', 'Finding': 'Diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 51%'}, {'Test': 'PA catheter insertion', 'Finding': 'Malposition of PA catheter due to kinking'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Malposition of PA catheter', 'Type': 'Mechanical complication', 'Location': 'Heart'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Manipulation of kinked PA catheter', 'Details': 'Use of fluoroscopy and guide wire to straighten the catheter'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Not specified', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient underwent successful surgical procedure'}}}"
"A 23-year-old, nulliparous, Chinese woman at 35 weeks gestation, was admitted to the hospital complaining of hematuria accompanied by severe pain in the left abdomen and left subcostal area. She had no past history of urological difficulties until week 26 of pregnancy when she was diagnosed with a spontaneous renal rupture resulting in acute left loin pain and hematuria. She denied any accident or renal problems at that time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis (Fig. a, b), and that the fluid around the ruptured left kidney had spread from the superior margin of the 10th thoracic vertebral body to the inferior margin of the second lumbar vertebral body. The patient was admitted to the hospital for observation. The hematuria resolved the day following admission, and she was discharged 1 week after admission when the loin pain decreased and her hemodynamic status was stabilized.\nAt 34 weeks gestation, she presented at the urology clinic with a growing mass in the left subcostal area. Ultrasound showed right renal hydronephrosis without hydroureter. In addition, a cyst was noted to surround the left kidney, and this was measured as 250 × 170 × 233 mm. The cyst was located under the left renal capsule, and the margins were 100 mm from the upper pole, and 60 mm from the lower pole of the left kidney. The medial margin of the cyst was 70 mm away from the medial edge of the left kidney, and 103 mm away from the lateral edge. It was suspected that she had a subcapsular hematoma following renal rupture. At the time, she was more than 33 weeks pregnant, and her laboratory values were normal for kidney function, hematocrit and hemoglobin. She declined further testing of the mass because she was concerned about the side effects on the fetus.\nThe patient came to the Obstetric Department requesting a cesarean section when she was 35 weeks pregnant because she could not bear the severe pain of the increasingly swollen left subcostal mass. She denied nausea, shortness of breath, fever or chills, and there was no vaginal bleeding or uterine contractions. After she was admitted to the obstetrics ward, the fetal heart non-stress test was determined to be reactive. The fetal bi-parietal diameter (BPD) measured by ultrasound was 86 mm, and femoral length. (FL) was 66 mm, which were both consistent with the gestational age. The amniotic fluid index was 95 mm and umbilical arterial S/D was 2.5. The biophysical profile score was 8. Additionally, ultrasound demonstrated signs of maternal hydronephrosis accompanied by a much larger cyst surrounding the left kidney than that observed in the previous ultrasound. Over the past few weeks, this sub-capsular cyst had increased to a size of 319 × 175 × 250 mm.\nPhysical examination revealed the gravid uterus, and obvious swelling over the left abdominal region. A large firm mass with undefined boundary was palpable over the left lumbar region extending to the side of uterus. The left flank and subcostal area had notable tenderness with significant hyperesthesia of the overlying skin. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count and hemoglobin. The urinalysis and kidney function values showed no abnormalities.\nThe patient was known to have had a spontaneous renal rupture and a growing mass in the left subcostal area at week 26 of gestation. The first diagnosis was hematoma or abscess surrounding the left kidney. Because her hemodynamic status was stable without anemia or fever for more than 2 months after the renal rupture, she had been followed using repeat urine analyses, which showed no hematuria. The urologist diagnosed her current condition as perirenal urine extravasation, and it was decided to place a percutaneous nephrostomy tube (PCN) before delivery or during the surgery.\nThe patient requested Cesarean section because the gestational age was 35 weeks, and due to concerns about the progression of the subcostal mass, the surgery was performed. The patient agreed to receive the PCN placement along with the Cesarean section. A male newborn weighing 2580 g with an Apgar score 10/10 at 1 and 5 min was delivered. Following completion of the Cesarean section, the patient’s upper abdominal cavity was explored, and, on the left side, a large retroperitoneal bulging mass was noted with an estimated size of 300 × 200 × 300 mm. The consulting urologist suctioned 5 ml of light yellow fluid from the mass and the sample was sent for creatinine determination. The creatinine level of the sample was 2100 μmol/L and similar to the level in the patient’s urine. A left urinoma as a result of spontaneous renal rupture was then diagnosed, and a total of 4 L of fluid was drained via the PCN. PCN was left in the urinoma to allow for further drainage of urine. After 3 days, a computer tomography (CT) scan was performed to assess the effect of draining the urinoma. The CT revealed that the PCN was properly placed in the cyst, and that the urinoma had decreased in size. The patient was discharged 1 week after the surgery with the PCN in place. She was closely followed by a urologist, and the nephrostomy tube was to be removed when there was no further drainage. Two months postpartum, the CT scan showed the cyst had diminished in size to 50 mm (Fig. ). Six months later, an ultrasound scan was performed and revealed that no perirenal extravasation was present. The urine analysis and renal function tests at that time were normal.","{

"A 22-year-old nulliparous Chinese woman with no significant family history of cancer presented to a private medical center with a painless 5 cm swelling in the left breast. The swelling, which was first noticed 3 months earlier, increased in size gradually. There was no associated nipple discharge or swelling elsewhere. Core biopsy of the swelling confirmed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with triple negative receptor status for ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for distant metastasis. By then, 2 weeks had passed since she first presented with her complaints. Following discussion between the attending surgeons, the patient, and her family, the decision to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy immediately, was made. Two weeks into her neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she complained that the left breast mass had significantly increased in size from the initial 5 cm to 10 cm in diameter. She also developed a swelling in the left axilla that was clinically consistent with that of an axillary lymph node. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the left axillary lymph node was reported to be a metastatic carcinoma. A decision was made to proceed with left mastectomy and axillary clearance. Histopathology examination of the 14 cm by 12 cm left breast mass was conclusive for high-grade metaplastic breast carcinoma – spindle cell subtype, triple negative receptor status. All 12 excised axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastases. Six weeks following surgery, she underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. She defaulted follow-up soon after completion of chemotherapy and underwent Traditional Chinese Medication instead, despite advice regarding potential spread of the disease, and grave prognosis should that occur.\nFour months later, she presented to a district hospital with complaints of pain over the left chest wall and inability to move her left upper limb. On examination, a large fungating mass with a necrotic patch was seen at her left chest wall, extending into the axilla. The tumor had infiltrated the anterior chest wall and was even seen over the posterior chest wall. The left upper limb was cold, pale, and mottled with patchy areas of necrosis. The brachial artery, radial artery, and ulnar artery were not palpable. Doppler signals were negative for all three arteries as well. Capillary refill time was significantly prolonged. There was no motor or sensory function in the left upper limb. A right breast lump was also noted during examination, measuring approximately 6 cm by 5 cm with enlarged ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. Core biopsy of the right breast lump revealed similar histopathology and immunohistochemistry findings as the left breast lump, supporting the suspicion of a metastatic disease, rather than a separate entity.\nCT of the thorax and abdomen was negative for distant metastases. CT angiogram was not performed, as the patient and family did not agree for her to undergo this invasive investigation. The patient was advised to have another round of palliative chemotherapy and debulking surgery, including a left forequarter amputation. She denied all modalities of intervention. She was given regular subcutaneous morphine and fentanyl patches for analgesia, and her wounds were dressed regularly. The left upper limb tissue gradually became waxy and soft. The flesh over the limb also began to spontaneously separate from the underlying bone, exposing parts of the humerus. The patient eventually requested amputation of the left upper limb, as it was becoming increasingly difficult for her family and nurses to take care of the truncal lesions with the rotting flesh and fragile, non-functioning limb getting in the way. The amputation at the site of the exposed left humerus was performed under intravenous sedation by an experienced orthopedic consultant. The patient succumbed 2 weeks later, slightly more than 6 months from the onset of the disease ( and ). The next of kin has provided written consent for publication of this case report and the accompanying images.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Gradually enlarging lump in the left side of the abdomen over 5 months', 'Dull aching pain and occasional vomiting'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasonography', 'Finding': 'Large multiloculated cystic mass occupying whole abdomen and pelvis'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Homogenous non enhancing retroperitoneal mass with mixed echogenic pattern'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Retroperitoneal MPNST', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Retroperitoneal region, abdomen'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical resection', 'Details': 'Resection of tumor en mass, primary colo-colic anastomosis'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No recurrence'}}}"
"An 80 year old female with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and endometrial cancer status post pelvic radiation and hysterectomy, with previous abdominal surgery secondary to iatrogenic colonic perforation during colonoscopy, presented to an outside facility four days prior to arrival at our institution due to severe colicky epigastric, periumbilical, and right upper quadrant pain of one day duration associated with nausea and chills. Patient was made NPO with NG decompression in addition to receiving empiric meropenem at the outside facility where a cholecystoduodenal fistula with large gallstone in the duodenal lumen was identified by abdominal CT. Upper GI was performed on hospital day four at the outside facility, which revealed failure of stone progression prompting transfer to our institution for definitive management. On intake exam her vitals were stable within normal limits and she was found to have no abdominal tenderness and no distention. Her laboratory values were without any significant abnormalities.\nGastroenterology attempted endoscopic retrieval of the duodenal gallstone, at which time the stone was noted to be 3.5 cm in diameter and obstructing the lumen of the bulbar duodenum. Endoscopic retrieval attempts resulted in partial fragmentation of the stone but were ultimately unsuccessful. The following day repeat abdominal CT revealed migration of the stone into the proximal jejunum ().\nThe decision to proceed with surgical removal hinged on the concern that further distal transit of the stone may result in it becoming lodged in a bowel loop contained in the patient's incisional hernia or a pelvic loop due to previous pelvic radiation. The abdomen was entered laparoscopically. Multiple areas of adhesions were encountered requiring adhesiolysis and ultimately the insertion of a hand port. The stone-containing small bowel was located and delivered through the hand port after which two stay sutures were placed on the antimesenteric border. An enterotomy was then made through which the gallstone was subsequently delivered (). Closure of the enterotomy was achieved via two transverse layers of suture and the bowel was returned into the abdomen. The cholecystoduodenal fistula was left intact for closure at a later date. The patient was transferred back to the general medical/surgical floor for post-operative recovery. Her diet was advanced on post-operative day 1 and she experienced return of gastrointestinal function on post operative day 2. The patient was discharged home on post operative day 2. She is now 16 months post-surgery and has had no recurrent symptoms.","{

"A male patient aged 49 years with no previous medical history presented with neck pain from a foreign object. The patient was accidentally struck by a projectile from a nail gun on a construction site. The patient complained of pain along the left side of the neck and inability to swallow. On initial evaluation, patient was neurologically intact with absent Horner's syndrome. There were no signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic instability. The head of the nail was visible behind and above the angle of the mandible at the level of the skin - neck zone 3 (Figure , Table )\nThe point of the nail was not visible in the oral cavity but was palpable along the oral mucosa along the left side of the oropharynx. The patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection without complications in an outlying emergency room (ER) and triaged to the local Level One trauma center for further management. Upon arrival to our trauma center, a computed tomography (CT) angiography of the neck was obtained which demonstrated the nail traversing in very close proximity to the left internal carotid artery close to the skull base with preserved flow proximal and distal to the nail. There was no active contrast extravasation or definitive presence of a pseudoaneurysm although the evaluation was limited by the beam-hardening artifact from the nail (Figure ).\nThe patient was emergently transported to the interventional radiology suite to determine the status of the left carotid artery and possible endovascular repair. Left common carotid angiography in the neck demonstrated preserved flow through the left internal carotid artery but significant vessel narrowing at the level of the nail (Figure ).\nFurther investigation with three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography demonstrated small areas of contrast stagnation proximal and distal to the nail with a small dissection flap proximal to the nail, consistent with at least a partial vessel injury (Figure ).\nThe intracranial left anterior circulation imaged normally without abnormal vessel dropout. Upon discussion among trauma surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery and neurointerventional teams, the decision was made to proceed with endovascular repair in conjunction with nail removal. The patient was given 600 mg of clopidogrel and 325 mg of aspirin via orogastric tube and was heparinized to an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250. The short 6F sheath was exchanged for 6F Terumo Destination sheath (Terumo Medical, Somerset, New Jersey, USA) and positioned in the distal left common carotid artery. The injury site was crossed with a Synchro-2 0.014 microwire (Stryker, Fremont, California, USA) under the fluoroscopic roadmap. A 5 x 25 mm Gore Viabahn covered stent (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) was positioned across the level of injury.

"A 23-year-old female was admitted with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings of intracranial tumor bleeding, after presenting with clinical symptom of dysarthria a week before admission. The patient had a past medical history of seizure due to diffuse astrocytoma, diagnosed 7 years previously. Initially she had undergone craniotomy and total tumor removal at another institution. The pathologic result from the first operation was diffuse astrocytoma, World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and afterwards the patient had not undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Her annual follow-up MRI showed slow changes in most medial corner of the tumor margin in MR fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) image which was not recognized until they were review retrospectively (). She was free of symptom for 7 years until she developed seizure with dysarthria and mild headache. The patient immediately underwent CT scanning which revealed hemorrhage at the right temporal lobe correlating with her tumor site. She was admitted to our hospital a week after the initial onset of the symptoms and brain MRI scan with enhancement, diffusion, spectroscopy, and perfusion were performed to confirm the tumor site and any other changes, such as evidence of malignant transformation. On MRI imaging there was evidence of acute hemorrhage at the previous tumor site with thin rim enhancement of the mass-like lesion with surrounding edema, suggesting possible malignant change to higher grade glioma. Increased regional cerebral blood volume (about >2-2.5) from the peripheral enhancing thin rim of the Lt. perisylvian superior temporal hemorrhagic lesion was also another evidence which suggests recurred tumor with probability of malignant transformation with intratumoral recent hemorrhage ().\nSuspecting the transformation of the hemorrhagic lesion to higher grade glioma, we performed frontotemporal craniotomy and total removal of the tumor. The tumor tissue was dissected and it was soft tissue with an irregular margin from normal brain tissue. The gross total resection of tumor was performed under navigation system.\nAfter tumor removal, the patient recovered without any neurological deficit and is not being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. We plan to withhold chemotherapy or radiation therapy for use in the event of possible later malignant recurrence. Her 4 and 16 months postoperative follow-up MRI after the second operation showed no significant differences other than post-operation changes and there was no sign or symptom of seizure or dysarthria.\nThe frozen biopsy showed vascular proliferation with necrosis, which was highly suspicious of high grade giloma, with the final histopathology results revealing WHO grade II diffuse astrocytoma with red blood cells and no evidence of malignant tumor cells. The pathologist remarked that the pleomorphism of the tumor was rare and the necrotic portions were mostly hemorrhagic necrosis rather than tumor necrosis. Ki-67 showed 1-2% staining with well-differentiated astrocytoma and minimal nuclear atypia. There was no definite hypercellularity (). In addition, because this was her second operation, neovascularization with granular tissues along the tumor margin can be considered as postoperative changes from initial operation.","{

"The patient was a 61-year-old female who had recurrent lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma in the right side of the mandible (Fig. ). Segmental resection of the mandible including the surrounding soft tissue with a 10-mm safety margin was scheduled.\nSurgical simulation and preparation of the surgical device were performed using a 3D model. First, the right and left mandibular rami of the 3D model were connected by the autopolymer resin to keep the preoperative position between the proximal and distal segments (Fig. a). Based on the findings in a CT image, segmental resection was performed on the 3D model with a safety margin of at least 10 mm from the tumor (Fig. b). Since it was necessary to extensively resect not only the mandibular bone but also the soft tissue surrounding the mandible, it was impossible to provisionally fix the reconstruction plate on the mandible before mandibular resection. Therefore, a surgical device that not only guides the direction of bone cutting but also restores the preoperative condylar head positioning in the temporomandibular fossa was needed. The device was made to fit the lower border of the anterior mandible and the posterior border of the mandibular ramus. The surgical device to guide the direction of mandibular resection had a U-shaped handle so that adaptation of the device would not interfere with the soft tissue to be removed and had holes to be fixed on the mandible with screws (Fig. c). A titanium reconstruction plate was bent so as to be inside at the area of resection in the 3D model.\nSegmental mandibular resection was performed via a submandibular approach. The surgical device was fixed on the mandible with two screws each at the proximal segment and distal segment (Fig. a). The mandibular resection was performed along the proximal and distal edges of the device fixed to the mandible (Fig. b). After the pre-bent titanium reconstruction plate had been fixed on the proximal and distal segments with screws, the screws used to fix the surgical device were removed (Fig. c). A panoramic radiograph showed that the mandible had been successfully reconstructed with the reconstruction plate since the preoperative relation between the proximal and distal segments and the position of the condylar heads in the temporomandibular fossae were maintained (Fig. ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for 1 month', 'Previous emergency exploratory laparotomy for 3-day-old abdominal pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Peptic perforation repaired with omental patch'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm x 7 cm'}, {'Test': 'Upper GI endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Small benign-looking ulcer at the pylorus of the stomach'}, {'Test': 'CT fistulogram', 'Finding': 'Complex gastrocutaneous fistula between the pylorus of stomach and anterior abdominal wall'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Complex gastrocutaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Digestive system', 'Location': 'Between stomach and abdominal wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Repeat surgery', 'Details': 'Omental patch repair and creation of feeding jejunostomy and retrograde tube duodenostomy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '4 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient had incisional hernia but was otherwise doing fine'}}}"
"A seven-year old boy was seen in the emergency department with a temperature and a painful right hip. This was thought to be a result of viral arthritis or an irritable hip. The patient was discharged home and his symptoms resolved. The patient was referred to the orthopaedic team after his symptoms returned, causing him significant pain to his right hip and preventing him from attending school. Apart from eczema, he had no other medical issues. On examination he had a very slight restriction of internal rotation in the right hip when compared to the left. However, this was completely pain free. A plain radiograph of the pelvis was performed, which was normal with no evidence of bony injury or Perthes disease (Figure ).\nAn MRI was requested but before this was performed the patient had another episode of right hip pain and a temperature of 38.2. He was, therefore, referred again to the orthopaedic team. On this occasion he walked into clinic with an antalgic gait. On examination he had some limitation of internal rotation compared to the left side. He had pain and tenderness around the right hip joint. He had normal neurovascular status distally. He had his MRI scan, which showed extensive myositis of the right obturator externus muscle and pectineus muscle with a small pocket of high signal collection (Figure ). It also demonstrated osteomyelitis in the right pubic bone. He was seen in clinic and scan results explained to the patient and his family. At this time he was relatively comfortable. He had a full range of motion to the hip and there was no tenderness around the hip joint. He could straight leg raise without any problems. There were no reported spikes in temperature. He was eating, drinking and playing as normal. His white cell count and C-reactive protein were normal but erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised slightly at 16.\nA second MRI scan was performed in December, which showed significant reduction in the degree of oedema at the right ischiopubic synchondrosis and in the surrounding soft tissue, particularly abductor and lateral rotators (Figure ). There was still marked oedema in the right parasymphyseal region likely in keeping with a further area of stress reaction or stress fracture. A further MRI was performed six weeks later (Figure ), which showed almost complete resolution of the abnormal high signal in the right obturator internus and pectineus and interval improvements in the inferior aspect of left sacral ala. There was, however, little interval change in the oedema/inflammation in the right superior and inferior pubis rami including the synchondrosis. The patient was referred to the paediatric orthopaedic consultant. At this point, clinically he was apyrexial and clinically well. He had a normal stance and a normal gait. He had normal power in both lower limbs and a full range of movement. He had no back or hip pain. Whilst it appears that this condition has improved and may resolve, we are unable to confirm the exact aetiology and the pathophysiology.","{

"A 30-years-old female Turkish patient referred to our clinic with compliant of unpleasant appearance of her anterior teeth. Patient has a history of a dentoalveolar trauma and a surgical operation before being referred to a dentist. She indicated that her smile has changed following the surgical operation which applied after the traffic accident in the year 2004. After the healing period she directed her complaints to the plastic surgeon but the doctor persuade her that the problem was related with her teeth only. Therefore the patient appealed to our clinic. The clinical and radiographic examinations revealed that all of the maxillary incisors were vestibulary positioned. The maxillary right canine along the maxillary incisors had oblique fractures involving enamel. The maxillary left lateral incisor had not fractured and was intact. The position of maxillary segment between the right premolar and left canine was approximately 3 mm lower than its ideal position (). Observing that the inferiority of right canine and lateral incisor is higher than the others, there is a probability that the segment not only placed 3 mm below its ideal position but also placed a few degrees deviation off the vertical axis (). The misplacement of the segment is explained to the patient and segmental osteotomy is suggested. The patient rejected the suggestion indicating that she is tired of serial surgical operations, thus the malpractice played a negative effect on her psychology as well.\nA conservative treatment was taken into consideration. The indication was porcelain laminate veneers for the maxillary incisors and right canine, all ceramic crown for maxillary right first premolar because of excessive hard tissue loss and a metal-ceramic fixed partial denture for the anterior mandible due to economic reasons.\nBefore the prosthetic treatment the maxillary right central incisor and first premolar was endodontically treated as they were found to be non vital during the vitality test. During preparation for ceramic veneers, the facial surfaces were reduced by 1.5-2 mm which resulted finishing the preparation on dentin and the incisal edges were reduced by 3-4 mm. All the incisors and canine were prepared with a chamfered finishing line with rounded internal line angles. Smooth margins were created to prevent stress concentration zones. Once the preparation was completed, impressions were made using polyvinylsiloxane impression material (Elite H-D, Zhermack, Germany), and cast in vacuum-mixed Type IV dental die stone (Fujirock, GC Corp, Tokya, Japan) according to the manufacturer recommendations. Stone dies were carefully separated from the impressions and two coats of die spacer (Spacer-Tray, Kerr) were applied 0.5 mm short of the finish line of the preparations. The veneers were waxed up to dies and they were fabricated from lithium disilicate-reinforced glass ceramic material, IPS Empress 2, using the heat press technique according to the manufacturer recommendations. After divestment the veneers were finished and glazed.\nThe inner surface of indirect veneers were treated with air-particle abrasion using 50 μm Al2O (Korox, Bego, Germany) with a chairside air-abrasion device (CoJet, 3M-ESPE, Germany) from a distance of 10 mm at a pressure of 250 kPa bar for 10 s. Then each surface treatment was followed by acid etching with 9% hydrofluoric acid (Pulpdent Corporation, USA) prior to silanization (). A silane coupling agent (Pulpdent Corporation, USA) was applied to the internal veneer surface for 60 s and air-dried.\nDuring the cementation process each tooth was etched for 15 s using a 37% phosphoric acid etch-gel (Alpha-Etch 37, Dental Technologies, USA). Subsequently, the tooth surface was rinsed thoroughly and air-dried gently. Dentin primer and adhesive were applied as the preparation reached dentin structure, according to the manufacturer instructions (Clearfil, Kuraray). Following the bonding application a thin layer of light polymerizing composite resin luting cement was applied at the intaglio surface of the veneers, placed onto the prepared teeth and light-polymerized for 40 s (Elipar Free Light, 3M ESPE) from palatal, buccal and incisal sides.\nExcess luting cement was removed and the marginal area was finished and polished with abrasive discs. The metal-ceramic fixed partial denture on the anterior mandibula and the full coverage all ceramic crown for maxillary right first premolar are constructed with conventional procedures and cemented (,). Restorations were checked to avoid any occlusal interference.\nThe patient was satisfied with her new smile line and excellent view of the anterior teeth (,). She was recalled in 2 days and encouraged for better dental flossing and also recalled every 6 months for periodical controls. No complication was observed during 3 years clinic service.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Large fungating right breast mass with associated weight loss and fevers'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Hypertension': True, 'LeftEarDeafness': True}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Core Biopsies', 'Finding': 'High-grade malignant neoplasm with features of carcinoma and carcinosarcoma'}, {'Test': 'PET/CT Fusion Scan', 'Finding': 'No evidence of metastatic disease'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Carcinosarcoma', 'Type': 'High grade', 'Location': 'Right breast'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Right radical mastectomy', 'Details': 'Removal of entire pectoralis major and minor musculature, level III axillary lymph node dissection'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Developed right upper extremity chronic lymphedema'}}}"
"A 41-year-old female reported to us with the chief complaint of swelling on the left side of her face since 1 month, which gradually increased in size and was observed by her and her relatives. She also complained of facial discomfort. Her motivation to seek treatment was due to the increase in the size of the swelling as observed by her relatives. During history taking, she revealed undergoing extraction of the second premolar in the second quadrant 2 months prior to the present swelling in her face. The tooth was extracted as it was grossly decayed, for which she had experienced pain and discomfort for a long time. The patient had ignored the initial tooth decay and had not sought any treatment till she developed pain and discomfort.\nOn physical examination, a swelling was noticed on the left side of the face []. This extended superiorly from the ala region of the nose to the malar prominence and inferiorly from the infra-orbital region to the upper part of the angle of the mouth approximately measuring 3 × 2 cm. The swelling was diffuse, but gave a firm feel on palpation. Intraoral examination showed a swelling corresponding to the second premolar region obliterating the upper buccal vestibule. It was firm on palpation and smooth in consistency. Dental and medical examination was not contributory. Lymph nodes could not be appreciated on palpation.\nNasal endoscopic examination revealed a congested maxillary sinus with a suspected nasal polyp.\nComputer tomography was subsequently performed with axial and coronal sections. This showed an abnormal mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus along with a breach in the anterior wall of the maxilla [Figures and ]. A soft tissue mass was seen to breach the sinus cavity and spilling over to the soft tissues of the facial region.\nAn incisional biopsy [] was performed and the tissue was subjected to histopathological examination. The histopathology [] showed epithelium and connective tissue. The epithelium showed pseudostratified ciliated columnar cells and connective tissue component with dense chronic inflammatory cells like plasma cells, Russel bodies and lymphocytes. The specimen also showed bony trabacule, blood vessels with extravasated RBCs. This gave an impression of chronic nonspecific inflammatory tissue. A functional endoscopic sinus surgery would be an ideal choice to approach a chronic sinus, but choice of surgical approach should be tailor made for each patient depending on the type of lesion encountered. Hence, observing the extent of the lesion, we decided to go for a conventional approach to this patient. The patient was then taken up under general anesthesia for a total excision of the lesion. The patient was intubated, painted and draped under standard aseptic conditions. A vestibular incision was placed and, on raising a sub-periosteal flap, we observed that the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus had been eroded and breached by the thick mucosal tissue of the maxillary sinus. The lesion was approached through this existing bony window. The entire mucosal lining was removed. A certain amount of lesional tissue was seen between the fibers of the levator labii superioris and the fibers of the zygomaticus minor muscle []. A blunt dissection was performed and the lesion was removed. The specimen was sent for histopathological diagnosis []. After achieving hemostasis, a bismuth iodine paraffin pack was placed and wound closure was done in with 4-0 monocryl. The patient was extubated uneventfully. She was prescribed an antibiotic, analgesic and nasal de-congesting medication.\nThe histopathology diagnosis was given as chronic inflammatory tissue of the left maxillary sinus [Figures and ]. Gomori-methenamine silver staining and Periodic acid Schiff staining were been performed for fungal hyphae, which turned out to be negative.\nThe patient was recalled after 1 week for suture removal and follow-up. The defect, which was created by the excision of the lesion, was rectified with acrylic prosthesis []. The patient has been on regular follow-up without any complications [].","{

"This 30 years old lady from a remote village of Assam, India had a mild pain at the right forearm for last 2 years. She developed a small swelling in that region which gradually increased in size. She took treatment from local doctors, but not getting relieved of her pain and swelling. She then came to Guwahati city for better treatment and visited one of the private hospitals. Biopsy was done there along with CT scan. Biopsy came out to be a soft tissue sarcoma. She was operated in that hospital and discharged 5 days after surgery. Immediate post-operative period was uneventful. She again developed pain at the surgical site one month after the surgery.\nShe was prescribed pain killers, but not getting relieved of her pain. After 6 months of this on and off pains, she was fade up and came to our institute. She was worked up extensively at our institute by the surgical oncology team. MRI of the arm showed residual disease and haziness around the neuromuscular bundle at the right arm. All pre-anesthetic work ups were done and the patient was put for surgery. Consent was taken regarding the consequences following brachial artery resection including amputation and requirement of great saphenous vein graft.\nThe patient was intubated and operated under general anesthesia in supine position. Scar of previous surgery was excised. On exploration, it was found that tumor was in close proximity to the neurovascular bundle. On tedious dissection, we were able to separate the tumor from the median nerve, but it was not possible to separate the tumor from the brachial artery. We had to excise 14 cm of the brachial artery. There was tumor thrombus inside the lumen of the brachial artery. After that, we had marked the course of great saphenous vein on the left leg. With careful dissection, we had isolated approximately 16 cm of the great saphenous vein. That segment was cut and placed on a saline filled tray after marking the proximal and distal end ().\nThat isolated vein segment was transferred to the right arm after reversing its ends. First, we had done anastomosis of the proximal end near the shoulder joint and next at distal end near the elbow. Anastomosis was done with 9-0 ethilon round body under microscope (). Both ulnar and radial artery pulsations were good at the end of the surgery. The glove drain was put around the anastomosis. Posterior arm slab was applied to restrict any movement of elbow and shoulder joint (). In post-operative period, we kept the slab for two weeks and after that arm pouch was advised. Limb elevation was continued for one month. She received chemoradiation following surgery.\nWe had discharged the patient on 7th post-operative day. For follow up, we advised the patient to come to surgical oncology/plastic surgery OPD at 2nd and 4th week and subsequently at 3rd, 6th and 12th month. We carried out a Doppler USG of the right upper limb at 6th and 12th months, which showed good flow at the great saphenous graft with minimal narrowing of anastomosis sites. Patient had no active complaint at the end of 12 months follow up.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Painless huge growth over left eye', 'Loss of vision in left eye'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health issues reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'HR-CT scan', 'Finding': 'Large homogenous mass covering the whole left orbit involving the globe'}, {'Test': 'Incisional biopsy', 'Finding': 'Squamous cell carcinoma of lower eyelid involving the whole of the eye'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Lower eyelid involving the whole of the eye'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Wide local excision, complete orbital exenteration, elective neck dissection, radiotherapy', 'Details': 'Tumour removal, orbital contents removal, neck node dissection, temporalis muscle flap, split thickness skin graft'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '10 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No signs of recurrence'}}}"
"A male patient aged 49 years with no previous medical history presented with neck pain from a foreign object. The patient was accidentally struck by a projectile from a nail gun on a construction site. The patient complained of pain along the left side of the neck and inability to swallow. On initial evaluation, patient was neurologically intact with absent Horner's syndrome. There were no signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic instability. The head of the nail was visible behind and above the angle of the mandible at the level of the skin - neck zone 3 (Figure , Table )\nThe point of the nail was not visible in the oral cavity but was palpable along the oral mucosa along the left side of the oropharynx. The patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection without complications in an outlying emergency room (ER) and triaged to the local Level One trauma center for further management. Upon arrival to our trauma center, a computed tomography (CT) angiography of the neck was obtained which demonstrated the nail traversing in very close proximity to the left internal carotid artery close to the skull base with preserved flow proximal and distal to the nail. There was no active contrast extravasation or definitive presence of a pseudoaneurysm although the evaluation was limited by the beam-hardening artifact from the nail (Figure ).\nThe patient was emergently transported to the interventional radiology suite to determine the status of the left carotid artery and possible endovascular repair. Left common carotid angiography in the neck demonstrated preserved flow through the left internal carotid artery but significant vessel narrowing at the level of the nail (Figure ).\nFurther investigation with three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography demonstrated small areas of contrast stagnation proximal and distal to the nail with a small dissection flap proximal to the nail, consistent with at least a partial vessel injury (Figure ).\nThe intracranial left anterior circulation imaged normally without abnormal vessel dropout. Upon discussion among trauma surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery and neurointerventional teams, the decision was made to proceed with endovascular repair in conjunction with nail removal. The patient was given 600 mg of clopidogrel and 325 mg of aspirin via orogastric tube and was heparinized to an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250. The short 6F sheath was exchanged for 6F Terumo Destination sheath (Terumo Medical, Somerset, New Jersey, USA) and positioned in the distal left common carotid artery. The injury site was crossed with a Synchro-2 0.014 microwire (Stryker, Fremont, California, USA) under the fluoroscopic roadmap. A 5 x 25 mm Gore Viabahn covered stent (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) was positioned across the level of injury. The nail was removed by gentle traction by trauma surgery with the simultaneous deployment of the Gore Viabahn covered stent into the left internal carotid artery spanning the injured segment. Follow-up angiography demonstrated excellent flow through the stent but with active extravasation secondary to a proximal endoleak related to incomplete apposition of the proximal stent to the vessel wall (Figure ).\nAt this time, the anaesthesia team noted blood pooling in the oropharynx. We introduced a 5 x 30 mm Aviator Plus balloon (Cordis, Milpitas, California, USA) and performed angioplasty of the proximal end of the stent. Follow-up angiography demonstrated no active extravasation and excellent flow through the stent (Figure ).\nCerebral angiography demonstrated no abnormal vessel dropout in the left anterior circulation. There was no further bleeding in the oropharynx or through the tract. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.\nOn a postoperative day one, the patient was extubated without incident. No neurological deficits were noted. The patient was continued on 325 mg of Aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily. The patient was cleared for an oral diet. Follow-up CT angiogram demonstrated patency of the left internal carotid stent and no pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure ). The patient did receive tetanus boosters and antibiotics as part of the initial management to prevent secondary infection. The patient was discharged to home on hospital day five. We planned to follow up the patient with CT angiogram at six weeks after the procedure. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain the imaging as the patient was out of state and was uninsured. Per phone conversation the patient was doing very well and did not report any symptoms consistent with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) at two months after the procedure. The patient stopped his clopidogrel one week after the procedure due to financial reasons but continues on the aspirin regimen.","{

"A 3-week-old male was referred to pediatric surgery for evaluation of a congenital lung lesion. He was born at 37 weeks via cesarean section for breech presentation with a birthweight of 2.78 kg. After birth, he developed respiratory distress and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit where a chest X-ray demonstrated multiple cystic lucencies in the right lung field initially concerning for a CPAM. Prenatal care was limited and it was unknown if the lesion had been previously diagnosed on ultrasound. He required CPAP for respiratory support which was weaned off on day 1 of life. He was discharged home on day 7 of life to follow up with pediatric surgery.\nHe presented for surgical consultation at 3 weeks of life. Examination revealed a well-appearing 3.75 kg infant, with clear breath sounds bilaterally and no evidence of heart failure. His parents reported no further respiratory symptoms. The computed tomography (CT) angiogram was obtained which revealed a cystic lung lesion in the right lower lobe with a large systemic artery originating from the distal thoracic aorta proximal to the origin of the celiac artery (\n). These findings confirmed the diagnosis of a PS. The need for surgery to avoid complications related to the sequestration was discussed with the infant's parents. Due to the large size of the systemic feeding vessel, we elected to perform angiographic embolization preoperatively to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding. Ideally, we would have performed resection at 3 months of age, but the procedure was delayed until 7 months due to social circumstances beyond our control. During that time, the infant remained asymptomatic.\nHe was admitted and underwent angiography via right femoral arterial access with interventional radiology. This demonstrated rapid flow through the feeding artery into the sequestration with brisk drainage into the right inferior pulmonary vein. Onyx 18 (ethylene vinyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide) was chosen for embolization because it is a pliable copolymer that would not interfere with the function of a LigaSure device or endothoracic stapler during surgery. We used an occlusion balloon to arrest flow within the feeding vessel so that the brisk arterial flow would not flush the copolymer through the lesion into the pulmonary vein while it hardened. Following embolization, there was no further flow through the sequestration; however, there was some flow noted proximally within the feeding vessel itself (\n). We were unable to embolize the entire length of the feeding artery because the occlusion balloon could not be placed more proximally in the vessel without risking inadvertent embolization into the aorta. Following this procedure, he was monitored in the PICU overnight before proceeding with surgery the following day.\nThoracoscopy was performed via a standard three-port approach with the infant in the left lateral decubitus position. Upon entry, the large systemic feeding artery itself was not thrombosed. However, the embolized portion of sequestered lung was clearly demarcated and appeared dark purple compared with the surrounding, well-perfused pink lung parenchyma. The inferior pulmonary ligament was mobilized allowing complete visualization of the embolized tissue within the right lower lobe. We had initially planned to perform lobectomy, but after this mobilization, it was clear that the lesion was peripheral and could be fully excised with a nonanatomical segmentectomy. The feeding vessel was mobilized circumferentially and divided using a LigaSure device. The lung parenchyma was similarly divided taking care to include a margin of well-perfused lung around the sequestration. A 16 Fr chest tube was placed and the lung re-expanded with no air leak noted. He was extubated and transferred to the surgical ward without complication. His chest tube was removed on postoperative day 1, and he was discharged on postoperative day 2.\nThe infant was seen in follow-up 2 weeks after surgery. His parents reported that his activity level was back to normal and denied pain or respiratory symptoms. Final pathology of the specimen confirmed an intralobar PS.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousHistory': 'Proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the left common femoral vein during pregnancy.'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'IVC filter leg penetrating the IVC wall and causing a duodenal perforation'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Duodenal perforation caused by IVC filter leg penetration', 'Type': 'Complication', 'Location': 'Duodenum'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Emergency laparotomy to remove IVC filter and repair duodenum', 'Details': 'Cutting off IVC filter leg and repairing duodenal perforation'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Ileus occurred, patient started oral intake after 14 days', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on the 20th postoperative day without complications'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Currently under follow-up observation', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient returned to work'}}}"
"We experienced a 55-year-old man who developed tetraplegia after neck spinal manipulation for stiff neck pain. The patient was healthy with no significant medical history and no previous history of taking medication (the patient denied taking aspirin or any other anticoagulant medications). But he had several previous mild neck pains and was relieved after manipulation treatment. The patient was treated with cervical manipulation and he felt pain and numbness in his lower limbs about 2 h after the end of the manipulation. The symptoms of his sensory abnormalities gradually worsened and spread upwards. The patient felt seriously ill and was immediately sent by his relatives to the emergency room of our hospital to visit a doctor. After being admitted to the emergency room, the patient was mentally alert during a physical examination. There was tenderness in the neck and increased muscle tension in both upper limbs. The superficial sensation of the upper limb had disappeared, but the deep sensation still remained. The lower extremity had 0/5 power on both sides. There were findings of sensory deprivation at the T2 dermatome and below, and anal tone was absent with the bulbocavernosus reflex. An imaging examination was performed after an indwelling catheter was inserted. There were no abnormal findings on a cervical vertebral X-ray and brain computed tomographic (CT) scans. A cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an acute posterior epidural hematoma from the C3 to T3 vertebrae (Figs. and ). MRI also showed a large heterogeneous collection within the right lateral epidural space of C4 until T1, which was consistent with the hyperacute epidural hematoma, with cord edema at the same level (Fig. ). The hematoma resulted in spinal stenosis, the narrowest of which was located at the C5 and C6 levels. There was no evidence of vertebral body fracture or subluxation. Clinical laboratory results at admission were normal and blood investigations showed that platelet counts were within the normal range with a normal coagulation profile (Table ). Subsequently, to exclude vascular malformations, the patient was scheduled to undergo CT angiography. CT angiography showed no malformation of the neck vessels (Fig. ).\nWe started intravenous prednisolone infusion to the patient to alleviate spinal edema and to prepare for spinal canal decompression and evacuation of the hematoma. During the operation, we saw a C4–T1 epidural hematoma and compression of the spinal cord at the corresponding level, especially at the C5–C6 levels. The hematoma was located in the right posterior part of the spinal cord, which is consistent with the results of MRI. The hematoma began to thin below the T1 level, and spinal cord compression was reduced accordingly. Therefore, we only removed the hematoma at the C4–T1 levels.\nAfter surgery, the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for further treatment. On postoperative day 1, there was some improvement in neurology, with a returning of upper extremity strength from 0/5 to 2/5. Superficial sensation and deep sensation between the T2–T8 levels changed from deprivation to hypoesthesia. On the 7th day after the operation, the patient’s symptoms improved further. His upper limb muscle strength increased to 4/5, but sensation below the T10 level was still absent. This condition remained until he was discharged from hospital. During a follow-up of 3 months after discharge, neurological function of the patient did not greatly recover.","{

"A 2-day-old male child was referred to orthopedic department with decreased movements of his right lower limb and both arms and being irritable. A 20-year-old primigravida with twin pregnancy had delivered the baby by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. The first of the twin was a female cephalic presentation and was delivered by normal vaginal delivery who did not have any complications. Non progress of labor and fetal distress with breech presentation compelled the surgeons to perform a cesarean section for the 2nd baby. A history of energetic traction and rotation was elicited from the operating surgeon since it was a difficult delivery as liquor had drained out in the 30 mins after delivery of 1st twin with the 2nd twin in distress. The operating surgeon applied a groin traction with a pull on the right leg and both arms to deliver the baby quickly no obvious sounds were heard during the extraction. A 2490 g female neonate was delivered who cried immediately after birth with Apgar scores of 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively.\nOn examination, the baby started crying on moving the right limb and the arms. Radiographs (infantogram) were obtained of both femur and humerus which revealed bilateral undisplaced humerus shaft fracture and a right femur fracture with displacement ( and ). The bone structure and mineralization was visibly normal and there were no other findings like blue sclera or other deformities, hypotonia on physical examination. Ophthalmic consultation was taken who performed an eye fundoscopy and reported as normal. Biochemical analysis such as serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase was normal. There was no positive family history or similar complaint in the other infant. We considered a working diagnosis of fracture of both humerus and right femur secondary to a birth injury.\nChild was treated by splinting the hip in flexion for the right femur and simple chest strapping for the humerus fracture for 3 weeks. The immobilization was removed, and the child was able to move both his arms and right lower limb actively. Follow-up radiograph showed both the humerus fracture had united and the right femur fracture showed good callus formation with no significant deformity (). Follow-up after 2 months showed complete union of the femur fracture both clinically and radiologically.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe pain on both thighs', 'Swelling and loss of function after trauma'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health issues reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Roentgenogram', 'Finding': 'Negative for fracture, no displaced patella'}, {'Test': 'Ultrasonography', 'Finding': 'Haematoma formation on both rectus femoris muscles'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Left haematoma diameter: 6 cm, Right haematoma diameter: 5 cm'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Thigh muscle strain', 'Type': 'Moderate strain', 'Location': 'Anterior surface of thighs'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative', 'Details': 'Compression bandage, ice application, rest, elevation, muscle relaxants, NSAID, isometric exercises'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Rapid and successful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Return to full athletic activities'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No recurrence of symptoms, normal MRI results'}}}"
"A male patient aged 49 years with no previous medical history presented with neck pain from a foreign object. The patient was accidentally struck by a projectile from a nail gun on a construction site. The patient complained of pain along the left side of the neck and inability to swallow. On initial evaluation, patient was neurologically intact with absent Horner's syndrome. There were no signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic instability. The head of the nail was visible behind and above the angle of the mandible at the level of the skin - neck zone 3 (Figure , Table )\nThe point of the nail was not visible in the oral cavity but was palpable along the oral mucosa along the left side of the oropharynx. The patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection without complications in an outlying emergency room (ER) and triaged to the local Level One trauma center for further management. Upon arrival to our trauma center, a computed tomography (CT) angiography of the neck was obtained which demonstrated the nail traversing in very close proximity to the left internal carotid artery close to the skull base with preserved flow proximal and distal to the nail. There was no active contrast extravasation or definitive presence of a pseudoaneurysm although the evaluation was limited by the beam-hardening artifact from the nail (Figure ).\nThe patient was emergently transported to the interventional radiology suite to determine the status of the left carotid artery and possible endovascular repair. Left common carotid angiography in the neck demonstrated preserved flow through the left internal carotid artery but significant vessel narrowing at the level of the nail (Figure ).\nFurther investigation with three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography demonstrated small areas of contrast stagnation proximal and distal to the nail with a small dissection flap proximal to the nail, consistent with at least a partial vessel injury (Figure ).\nThe intracranial left anterior circulation imaged normally without abnormal vessel dropout. Upon discussion among trauma surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery and neurointerventional teams, the decision was made to proceed with endovascular repair in conjunction with nail removal. The patient was given 600 mg of clopidogrel and 325 mg of aspirin via orogastric tube and was heparinized to an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250. The short 6F sheath was exchanged for 6F Terumo Destination sheath (Terumo Medical, Somerset, New Jersey, USA) and positioned in the distal left common carotid artery. The injury site was crossed with a Synchro-2 0.014 microwire (Stryker, Fremont, California, USA) under the fluoroscopic roadmap. A 5 x 25 mm Gore Viabahn covered stent (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) was positioned across the level of injury. The nail was removed by gentle traction by trauma surgery with the simultaneous deployment of the Gore Viabahn covered stent into the left internal carotid artery spanning the injured segment. Follow-up angiography demonstrated excellent flow through the stent but with active extravasation secondary to a proximal endoleak related to incomplete apposition of the proximal stent to the vessel wall (Figure ).\nAt this time, the anaesthesia team noted blood pooling in the oropharynx. We introduced a 5 x 30 mm Aviator Plus balloon (Cordis, Milpitas, California, USA) and performed angioplasty of the proximal end of the stent. Follow-up angiography demonstrated no active extravasation and excellent flow through the stent (Figure ).\nCerebral angiography demonstrated no abnormal vessel dropout in the left anterior circulation. There was no further bleeding in the oropharynx or through the tract. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.\nOn a postoperative day one, the patient was extubated without incident. No neurological deficits were noted. The patient was continued on 325 mg of Aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily. The patient was cleared for an oral diet. Follow-up CT angiogram demonstrated patency of the left internal carotid stent and no pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure ). The patient did receive tetanus boosters and antibiotics as part of the initial management to prevent secondary infection. The patient was discharged to home on hospital day five. We planned to follow up the patient with CT angiogram at six weeks after the procedure. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain the imaging as the patient was out of state and was uninsured. Per phone conversation the patient was doing very well and did not report any symptoms consistent with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) at two months after the procedure. The patient stopped his clopidogrel one week after the procedure due to financial reasons but continues on the aspirin regimen.","{

"We encountered a 43-year-old female patient who presented in shock with cool clammy extremities, tachycardia with a rate of 135 and blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg. This was preceded by a history of 12h of abdominal pain and progressive distention without a history of trauma. The patient was alert oriented to time place and person with a oxygen saturation of 94% and respiratory rate of 24. Her medical history was positive for a stroke 1 year ago for which she was on warfarin and clopidogrel. We could not find out whether she was allergic to aspirin. We started the primary treatment of shock and bolused her with intravenous fluids, started nasal oxygen, put her on a monitor and collected cultures and blood for complete blood count, differential, electrolytes, type and cross, renal and liver profile. An International Normalize Ratio (INR) test and Prothrombin time were also ordered. Suspecting the worse case scenario of internal hemorrhage secondary to warfarin toxicity we performed a bedside ultrasound which was positive for free fluid in the abdomen. Her laboratory values came back with hemoglobin of 4 gm%, a normal white count, platelet count and an INR of 8 which was way beyond the normal range. After stabilizing her with intravenous normal saline boluses of 2 L, we did a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to identify a visceral source of bleeding. CT abdomen showed free fluid in the sub diaphragmatic spaces with CT attenuation value of 30 suggesting hemoperitoneum []. CT also showed a segment of grossly thickened bowel loop []. The patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. More than 2 L of blood was suctioned from the abdomen. There were 2 ft of small bowel and its mesentery which were found to be hemorrhagic and severely congested []. No active sites of bleeding could be identified. The source of bleeding was probably mesenteric vessels. Since the segment of bowel did not appear healthy it was resected and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. Anticoagulants were withdrawn.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for 1 month'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Emergency exploratory laparotomy for peptic perforation with burst abdomen'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm × 7 cm'}, {'Test': 'Upper GI endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Benign ulcer at the pylorus of the stomach'}, {'Test': 'CT fistulogram', 'Finding': 'Enterocutaneous fistula between the pylorus of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Complex gastrocutaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Complication of previous surgery', 'Location': 'Pylorus of the stomach and anterior abdominal wall'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Repeat surgery', 'Details': 'Repeat omental patch repair, feeding jejunostomy, retrograde tube duodenostomy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '4 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient doing fine with incisional hernia'}}}"
"A 65 year-old male was suffering from chronic abdominal pain and foreign body sensation following incisional hernia repair with mesh in 2010. In March 2010, the patient underwent an open right hemicolectomy for benign multiple colonic polyps and subsequently developed an incisional hernia. In November 2010, he underwent open incisional hernia repair with an onlay Prolene mesh. Subsequent to the mesh repair, he had sharp pain in the epigastric area particularly when bending forward and fullness in his upper abdominal region. He was referred to the outpatient general surgery clinic at a tertiary level hospital for an assessment. On focused abdominal exam, he had a midline laparotomy incision with no acute signs of infection. There was fullness superior to his umbilicus with a palpable subcutaneous mass measuring approximately 6 cm in diameter. Cross sectional imaging revealed an ovoid collection in the anterior abdominal wall, measuring 4.4 × 8 cm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3.3 × 5.4 cm on computed tomography (CT). In addition, an abnormal calcification superior to the collection could be appreciated on CT (). These findings were suggestive of a chronic hematoma and scar tissue. The patient agreed to undergo debridement of chronic hematoma and partial mesh excision. Intraoperatively, the ovoid collection was approached via a midline incision and was encountered after dissection through the subcutaneous tissue. It was comprised of a thick rind of scar and fibrous tissue, measuring approximately 8 × 8 cm. It was unroofed, with immediate expression of old hematoma as well as fibrous tissue. Part of the overlying Prolene mesh and thick scar tissue were excised. The remainder of the Prolene mesh was well incorporated to his fascia and left in place. As the superior aspect of the collection was dissected out by entering deep to the fascia, a piece of calcified tissue was dissected out from the preperitoneal space superior to the mesh. It was suspected to be heterotopic ossification, and it was removed (). The fascia was then primarily repaired, and then the incision was closed in layers after thorough irrigation. On postoperative follow-ups in the clinic at 2 and 6 weeks, the patient was doing well, and his pain had improved significantly.\nSymptoms of epigastric pain and fullness in the upper abdomen were gone. There was no recurrence of an incisional hernia on clinical examination.\nSpecimen sent for microbiology was negative for fungal and bacterial growth. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed soft tissue with osseous metaplasia which is consistent with heterotopic ossification. The cause of this patient pain was likely secondary to a chronic hematoma and scarring, and surprisingly, an abnormal calcified mass consistent with heterotopic ossification.","{

"A 14-year-old healthy male child presented to accident & emergency department with complaints of inability to walk or bear weight on his left lower limb after he spontaneously dislocated his patella while running on uneven ground. Upon further inquiry, the patient gave a history of similar episode 10 months back following a fall. At that time, his mother pushed the patella back after which he was taken to the hospital where radiographic images showed that patella was reduced with no associated fracture of patella, tibial tuberosity or femoral condyles. He was given a full length leg cast for 1 month after which he was able to resume his daily activities without any difficulty. There was a family history of recurrent patellar dislocation (father). Previous hospital records revealed that he had history of anterior knee pain with a positive apprehension sign indicating lateral patellar instability.\nOn examination, the knee was markedly swollen with obvious deformity in the lateral aspect in the form of tenting of the skin and soft tissue by underlying patella without any contusion or bruise. The knee was locked in 15 degrees of flexion and patient was unable to perform any movements at the knee joint. A provisional diagnosis of lateral dislocation of patella was made. Standard anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs were taken which showed a laterally displaced and vertically rotated patella along its long axis with the medial patellar edge locked and dipping into the lateral gutter (). There was no evidence of associated fracture or signs of osteochondral damage. General examination showed no hyperlaxity of the joints. Clinical signs of genu valgum, patella alta, tibial torsion or trochlear dysplasia were absent and the Quadriceps (Q) angle on the normal limb was within normal range (11 degrees).\nAn attempt to closed reduction was made under conscious sedation but was not successful. A decision for open reduction was made and patient was shifted to operating room. A midline vertical incision was given along the knee joint. The patella was found to be locked with its articular surface facing laterally and the medial edge of patella locked past the lateral femoral condyle and wedged into the lateral gutter. The medial patellar retinaculum was found stretched and attenuated but no tear or defect was noticed.\nA small incision was given along the lateral retinaculum, the index finger inserted was through it and the wedged medial patellar edge was freed from the lateral femoral condyle; and at the same time lifting the patella out of the lateral gutter, it was relocated to its anatomical position.\nThe stability and tracking of the patella was checked and it showed a tight lateral retinaculum along with a lax medial retinaculum. Release of the lateral retinaculum was done along with medial patellar retinaculum plication using multiple interrupted prolene sutures (). Patellar stability and tracking was rechecked and found to be good. Standard skin closure was done and a long leg hinged knee immobiliser was applied. Post operative radiograph showed patella relocated in the trochlear groove ().\nPatient was allowed full weight bearing on day one. Quadriceps setting exercises and active straight leg raising were started in the second post operative week. Progressive active and passive range of motion exercises were started after 3 weeks and full range of motion was achieved by 7 weeks. Patient resumed his sporting activities by 6 months post operative with no recurrence or any symptoms at the time of final follow up of 18 months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Swelling and pus discharge in relation to the right side of mandible'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Fracture of the mandible on the right side due to a motor vehicle accident'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Extraoral Examination', 'Finding': 'Obvious swelling of 1 × 1.5 cm in size with crusty appearance, sinus opening, and pus discharge'}, {'Test': 'Intraoral Examination', 'Finding': 'Inter dental wiring, missing 31, rotation of 41, 42, and 32, anterior open bite, posterior open bite on the left side'}, {'Test': 'Orthopantomogram', 'Finding': 'Presence of bone plate and screws near developing roots of 43 and 45, fracture line on right side extending from interdental area of 42 and 83, step deformity in lower border, malunion of subcondylar fracture on left side'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Malunited fractures of the body and condyle of the mandible on opposite sides', 'Type': 'Fracture', 'Location': 'Mandible'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical correction', 'Details': 'Removal of interdental wiring, retrieval of screws and bone plate, prophylactic extraction of teeth 83, 84, and 85'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '45 days', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Swelling subsided, sinus healed, eruption of teeth 44 and 43 observed, occlusal adjustments made'}}}"
"A 22-year-old female patient visited the outpatient department with a complaint of pain in the left jaw joint region since 1½ months. On eliciting the history, patient had pain on mastication and difficulty in opening the mouth due to which she was on the soft diet. Medical history revealed that she was diagnosed with RA 6 months back. The patient took homeopathy medicines for 1 month. But presently was not on any medication. On clinical examination of TMJ, the following signs and symptoms were assessed: Left side TMJ was associated with pain, TMJ range of motion was limited, associated with pain while maximum unassisted mouth opening (18 mm) and while lateral excursion [], deviation of mandible toward left side while opening mouth was noticed. No clicking sounds on opening, closing and lateral movements. Muscles of mastication were tender on palpation. Intra orally, no teeth were carious, no occlusal prematurity was noticed. On radiological examination, panoramic radiograph depicted irregular erosions in the left condyle and decreased joint space both on right and left side. The findings were of degenerative joint disease but nonspecific due to the overlapping of structures []. TMJ tomography both open and closed mouth revealed slight erosion in the anterior surface of the left condyle but was not clearly appreciated []. Further evaluation was carried out by CBCT.\nCone beam computed tomography images revealed sclerosis of the outer surface of the condylar head, narrowing of the articular space bilaterally (more on the left). Coronal left closed mouth view revealed loss of joint space, loss of cortical bone on the superior surface and condylar head erosions compared to right side, which shows normal joint space and condylar structure [Figure and ]. Coronal left open mouth view revealed narrowing of the articular space and erosions on superior head of condyle and right side depicting no changes in the joint space [Figure and ]. Sagittal view open and closed mouth revealed decrease in joint space with erosions of the superior surface of the condyle on the left side [Figures and , and ]. Hand wrist radiograph revealed the joint space narrowing of the distal phalange of the right thumb, narrowing of 3rd and 4th proximal phalanges and erosion of the middle phalange seen of index finger []. Knee and shoulder joint radiographs revealed no changes. Serum investigations were advised and it revealed rheumatoid factor (RF)-340 IU/ml (normally <40 IU/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP)-368 mg/dl (normally <0.8 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)-40 mm/h (normally <20 mm/h in females). All serum markers for RA were elevated. Final diagnosis of RA affecting TMJ was arrived at.\nPatient was referred to rheumatologist for the further treatment, and she was prescribed Tab Methotrexate 75 mg once a week for 2 months and anti-inflammatory drug twice a day for 15 days and patient responded well to the treatment. Liver function test was also monitored with periodic follow-up. After 2 months of the follow-up, patient reported relief of pain and improvement in mouth opening.","{

"A 26-year-old Asian woman currently residing in the UK presented to the ENT outpatients department with a lump on the right side of her lower neck. She noticed the swelling six weeks prior to presentation and it had been gradually increasing in size. She had no systemic symptoms and had a good apetite and her weight had been stable. Her past medical history was insignificant apart from a diagnosis of polycystic ovaries.\nOn examination there was a nontender firm to hard lump in the right thyroid lobe, measuring 4 × 4 cms. The rest of the ENT examination including flexible nasolaryngoscopy was normal. There was no other lymphadenopathy and the respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examination was unremarkable.\nThe routine laboratory test results and thyroid function tests were normal except for a raised ESR of 40 mm/hr. Ultrasound examination of the neck revealed a 35 × 18 mm cystic mass in the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe with internal echoes (Figures and ). An ultrasound guided FNA of the above mass revealed 10 cc of frank pus which raised the clinical suspicion of TB, and subsequent culture was positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis. Ultrasonogram also revealed some abnormal lymph nodes in the right level 2 area of neck (). Her mantoux test was 34 mm. Chest X-ray was normal. This patient was referred to the chest physicians and was started on standard quadruple therapy.\nShe was seen recently approximately 12 months post treatment and has responded well to treatment and her neck swelling has disappeared. She is euthyroid. A repeat ultrasound showed complete resolution of the neck mass and lymph nodes.\nAlthough tuberculosis has been reported in many parts of the human body, thyroid involvement is extremely rare and its true incidence is unknown. The rarity of this disease is attributed to various factors including bactericidal property of colloid material and high thyroid blood flow [].\nTuberculosis of the thyroid gland may be primary or occur in association with tuberculous infection of other organs []. It can present as multiple thyroid lesions associated with military tuberculosis, solitary caseating thyroid nodule, cold abscess, chronic fibrosing type, and acute abscess [].\nThe clinical presentation of thyroid tuberculosis can range from being totally asymptomatic to solitary, multinodular goitre with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, meningitis, dysphagia, or pyrexia of unknown origin. It can sometimes mimic thyroiditis and cancer. Most of the patients are euthyroid. A high ESR and a positive mantoux test may suggest tuberculosis [].\nUltrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a useful diagnostic method in thyroid tuberculosis. It is our practice to perform FNA on almost all neck lumps and it is the aspirate of frank pus in a high-risk patient that raised the suspicion of tuberculosis in our patient.\nThe diagnosis has to be substantiated by histopathologic findings of caseating granuloma and/or identification of AFB on culture. Other investigation modalities include chest X-ray, sputum analysis, PCR, and cultures with 14C-labelled compounds.\nTreatment of thyroid tuberculosis does not differ from other forms of this disease.\nAntitubercular drugs remain the main stay of treatment. The concomitant use of two or three effective drugs has to be prolonged for at least six months with appropriate followup. Surgery may be indicated in acute abscesses to avoid total destruction of the thyroid gland.\nIf left untreated, it can cause complete destruction of the thyroid gland and result in hypothyroidism. The thyroid hormone levels should be monitored before, during, and after treatment.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Acute right knee pain during dancing the quick-step', 'Patella shifting laterally with external rotation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No history of previous knee trauma or dislocations'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'AP radiograph', 'Finding': 'Laterally dislocated patella'}, {'Test': 'Lateral radiograph', 'Finding': 'Rotated patella impacted in the intercondylar notch of the femur'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Patellar dislocation', 'Type': 'Orthopedic injury', 'Location': 'Right knee joint'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Closed reduction under general anaesthetic', 'Details': 'Successful relocation of patella with closed technique'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No evidence of ligamentous injury or bony damage, normal function in knee'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months post-injury', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient to be followed up for further assessment'}}}"
"He was 16-year old school going boy who lived at home with his family was diagnosed with locally advanced head and neck cancer with no known distant metastasis []. The extent of the cancer involved entire left side of the face, left ear, and scalp. He had visual loss in his left eye and facial disfigurement. He was cared for at home by his mother and grandmother. His father lived and worked in a different city and he had one teenage sibling who was his younger sister. After the initial diagnosis, he underwent radical facial surgery including maxillectomy and postoperative chemo radiotherapy. He was Ryle's tube fed after the surgery due to dysphagia. One year later, he had recurrence of the cancer at the operative site. He had an ulceroproliferative wound involving the left side of the face, eroding the left ear canal. The wound was infected and was covered with slough and maggots. He was referred to the community PC by his primary treating doctors for symptom control and specialist PC. At this point of time, he had disease progression on the treatment and options of disease modifying treatment were very limited.\nHe was seen regularly in the community by a multidisciplinary PC team. During the initial visit the patient had uncontrolled pain and purulent discharge from the left side of the face. He was studying in class 9 and had discontinued his schooling. He was fairly independent with activities of daily living and use to watch television and occasionally, turn pages of a magazine, and see pictures. His mood was depressed and often had crying spells. His grandmother was very loving and supportive and her presence was very comforting to him. He always perceived that his mother did not love him, as she was more devoted to the care of his younger teenage sister and household work. His father was away most of the time and had little involvement in boy's care. His sister had a blunted affect and had little involvement in his brother's life or his care.\nHis pain was optimally controlled at home with oral analgesics administered through Ryle's tube. After initial wound debridement, daily dressings were done at home. The team advised patient's father to take time off work and spend time with his son. Along with the patient, all the members of the family received one to one counseling. During the interview, these were the remarks made by the patient. “My mother does not love me and she is not interested in my care.” “I am all alone here and I miss my friends and school.” “I look very bad.” “I do not like what's happening.” These were few remarks made by his parents. “He is our only male child.” “We have struggled to raise him up.” “He was very smart and good looking, look at him now.” We spent all our money on his treatment. His grandmother was caring, optimistic and was always hoping for a miracle cure. His sister had little knowledge about her brother's prognosis, and when confronted with a question about she losing her only brother she was quiet and expressed no emotions. Members of the team had regular debrief sessions among themselves and also externally. Over the period of next 2 weeks, he had involvement of his right eye and had total loss of vision. His general condition gradually worsened and he needed maximal support with activities of daily living. His hearing was still present and he still used to recognize the presence of the health personnel. On further interviewing the patient's mother, her avoidance behavior was due to the fear of losing her only son. She was further counseled, and later on she was more involved in her son's care and was able to spend quality time with her son. He died 2 weeks later at home in the presence of his family with his mother holding his hand.\nThe PC team made two bereavement visits and following were the few remarks made by the patient's family. “Before death he coughed out all the secretions, we thought he will recover fast.” “We were able to spend a lot of time with our son during his last days.” “We thank you for being honest and letting us know he will die, your sincere guidance helped us to support our son throughout the period of illness, dying, and death. Though it was a difficult experience for the team throughout it was also a very rewarding experience. It was an excellent experience for the team members. During the four weeks time, the team was confident enough to face the similar challenges in providing palliative care to the needy clients.\nSome of the issues identified in this situation are as follows.\nCaring for adolescent - difficulties faced compared to caring for adults: level of the stress; poor self-esteem of the child; increased anxiety among parents, grandparents, child, and care providers; impact on the development of siblings; job/home interaction of parents; family coping. The body image: weight loss; muscle weakness; skin changes; disfigurement of face; growth on face; loss of vision; incontinence and catheter. Psychosocial issues: no friends and separation from peers: anger; discontinuation of education; diminished interaction with the family members; financial burden; anxiety; depression. Family members’ feelings/emotions: (some of the points parents expressed during grief and bereavement period.) he is the only male child; brought up to the age of 16 years and he was studying in class 9; he was very smart, good looking and helpful boy; spent money for his treatment instead of his study; crying all the time; before death he coughed out all the secretions, mother thought he will recover fast; while dying he held his mother's hands that provided lot of emotional satisfaction to the mother. Team experiences: Such clients should get good and effective care that gives quality of life to the terminally ill patients.We satisfied with the care provided to the child as the family members expressed their gratitude about our service. Learning experiences: managing complex symptoms issues; prioritization of care; building a therapeutic relationship; communicating prognosis; open and truthful communication; breaking the bad news; giving psychosocial support; building up team spirit.","{

"In July 2008, a 50 year-old white male was referred to us for evaluation of the decision by his primary care physician to maintain him on life-long anticoagulation, a decision based on the findings of deficiencies of both protein C and protein S. He is in good health and has no known family history of DVT or coagulation abnormalities. In June 2006, he fell from a tree at work, and a fracture of his right femur was redressed by insertion of a titanium rod. One week after surgery, he complained of pain in his right calf. DVT was confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography and he was anticoagulated with heparin and Coumadin and maintained on 9 mg Coumadin and 325 mg aspirin until June 2007 when he began noticing spontaneous bruising and large hematoma appearing without provocation. He requested that his primary care physician re-evaluate the basis for his anticoagulation. Blood drawn while he was taking a therapeutic Coumadin dose was sent to a regional laboratory for a thrombophilia work up. Results of laboratory tests were significant for protein S activity levels 36% [normal range 54-130%] and protein C activity levels 10% [normal range 70-130%]. Protein C and protein S antigen levels were not performed, and the test results were interpreted as a protein C and protein S deficiency. In our laboratory we drew a blood sample while the patient was taking Coumadin and we prepared citrate platelet poor plasma from blood with the results shown in . We report a normal coagulation profile and normal response to the prescribed Coumadin dose, with no evidence of thrombophilia. There was no evidence of elevated fibrinogen levels or abnormal fibrinogen variants. Antithrombin levels were 100% as would be anticipated in a patient on Coumadin for such a long period of time. Protein C and protein S were within range expected for the degree of anticoagulation. He was returned to his primary care physician with recommendation that, although he did not have a protein C or protein S deficiency he should remain on Coumadin until resolution of the venous obstruction that occurred consequent to the surgery is confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography. In a healthy male with a first DVT occurring after surgery or trauma, the calculated risk of DVT recurrence is 0.27 very low []. It is estimated that 10% of recurrences occur at 2 years and 23% at 5 years post anticoagulation therapy []. Unresolved DVT may lead to post-phlebitic syndrome and to a 2.6% annual, 12.4% at 5 years and 16.5% at 7 years increased risk of recurrent DVT [].\nOral anticoagulation was discontinued based on a clotting profile negative for thrombophilia and Doppler ultrasonography pattern consistent with normal blood flow in the deep veins of the right calf and thigh predicting a minimal calculated risk for DVT recurrence.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Headache and fever for a few days', 'Personality changes with violent behavior and speech disabilities'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant medical history'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Brain MRI', 'Finding': 'Mild brain edema'}, {'Test': 'CSF analysis', 'Finding': 'Lymphocyte pleocytosis suggesting inflammatory changes'}, {'Test': 'T1-weighted pelvic MRI', 'Finding': '5 × 7 mm fat intensity in the right ovary'}, {'Test': 'T2-weighted pelvic MRI', 'Finding': 'Large number of similar-sized ovarian follicles surrounded by teratoma'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal CT', 'Finding': 'Fatty component in the right ovary (−62.5 HU)'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Anti-NMDAR encephalitis', 'Type': 'Autoimmune disease', 'Location': 'Brain'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Plasma exchange treatment', 'Details': 'Administered due to positive anti-NMDAR-antibody test'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Gradual improvement in clinical findings and symptoms', 'DischargeStatus': 'Improving conscious level and reduction of involuntary movements'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Able to ingest food independently and walk with assistance'}}}"
"A 23-year-old male patient was referred to our tertiary academic centre because of a defect affecting one side of his face. The patient underwent adenotonsillectomy at 6 years of age, and numbness started to affect the left side of his face 3 months after surgery. At that time, he was informed by his physician, who performed the operation, that there were no problems. However, the numbness affecting the left side of his face increased, and shrinkage and weakness of the left side of the face occurred over the next 2 years. In ten years after surgery, his complaints and symptoms increased (Figures and ) but he could not see the doctor for socioeconomic reasons.\nA physical examination at the time of referral to our centre revealed atrophy of cutaneous and subcutaneous fat tissue on the left side of the patient's face, phthisis of the left ocular bulb and corneal atrophy, left zygomatic atrophy, and asymmetry (Figures , , and ). Hemiglossal atrophy and an increased size of fissures of the left side of the tongue were also seen (). Maxillary atrophy displaced the left upper teeth in an upward and backward direction ().\nThe patient had no dermal lesions or involvement of the extremities. There was no family history of PHA. The patient underwent autologous fat injection at 14 and 16 years of age, but the desired result was not sustained and the atrophy continued (). No antibodies were detected in serological tests. Sedimentation and core reactive protein levels were within normal limits, suggesting that the facial disorders were not caused by inflammatory diseases. Computed tomography revealed no apparent neurodegeneration (), eliminating Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) from the differential diagnosis. The computed tomographic images revealed a decrease in left retroorbital fat tissue and atrophy of the ocular bulb (). The left temporal muscle was atrophic compared with the right temporal muscle (). Magnetic resonance angiography was performed to detect possible vascular causes but revealed no vascular abnormalities of the internal and external carotid arteries or of their branches ().\nThe patient was informed that surgical reconstruction of his facial asymmetry would not stop the progression of the disorder and that the cosmetic results would probably be temporary. The patient did not wish to undergo any surgical interventions.","{

"A 25-year-old male patient re-presented to our department for the first time in 7 years with otorrhea in the right ear and recurrent meningitis. He had been treated for meningitis in another hospital and had experienced fever and seizures two weeks before visiting our hospital. The patient had a history of multiple surgeries for cholesteatoma and had been treated for severe otitis media at the age of 2 years, at which point right temporal bone osteolysis was identified. He subsequently suffered from recurrent meningitis and underwent several brain abscess drainage procedures. At ten years of age right temporal bone surgery was performed to rebuild the separation between the middle ear and lateral temporal lobe. At 16 years, he was diagnosed with cholesteatoma, and radical mastoidectomy was performed. Further details of these operations, performed at other hospitals, were not available. We were unable to obtain detailed past medical records regarding treatment (including surgical procedures) of his cholesteatoma, and we could not estimate whether the past intervention of the cholesteatoma was appropriate. When the patient was 17 years old, he visited our department for the first time to undergo assessment for controlling cholesteatoma, recurrent meningitis, and otalgia. First, tympanoplasty was performed to assess the disease and remove residual cholesteatoma from the middle ear; cholesteatoma was diagnosed by histopathological analysis. It was not possible to determine whether the cholesteatoma was a residual congenital cholesteatoma or a secondary cholesteatoma formed as a result of osteolysis of the external auditory canal or middle ear. At that time, we hesitated a more extensive procedure because of his age and limited information about his past surgical interventions. Meningitis and otalgia were subsequently controlled. However, after six months, when he was 18 years old, the patient experienced another episode of meningitis. At that time, he was also suffering from an epidural abscess, which was drained during hospitalization. He attended our department until he was 19 years old, at which point he chose to discontinue the hospital visits.\nWhen the patient presented at our department again at the age of 25 years, computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed massive osteolysis of the temporal bone (Fig. a−c). Notably, while most of the temporal bone had disappeared, the cochlear bony lateral wall was relatively well preserved, and his hearing by bone conduction had not been completely lost. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the temporal lobe of the brain had herniated into the mastoid (Fig. d). Compared with a previous CT scan image (Fig. e), there is clear progression of boney destruction during a time when the patient did not undergo any surgery to the temporal bone. At this point, we chose an observational approach as otorrhea had spontaneously resolved. However, during the patient’s follow-up, otorrhea recurred, and cerebrospinal otorrhea was suspected. The patient was hospitalized and treated conservatively with antibiotics. Once again, the otorrhea resolved spontaneously with 2 weeks of bed rest, and skull base reconstruction was planned to prevent recurrence.\n?A3B2 twb=.27w?>Pre-operative CT imaging with three-dimensional reconstruction clearly revealed not only temporal bone osteolysis but also spotted osteolysis of other bones of the skull, including the mandibular bone, zygomatic bone, and contralateral temporal bone (Fig. f). At this point, Gorham-Stout disease was suspected for the first time. To support the diagnosis of Gorham-Stout disease (by ruling out other possible differential diagnoses), we performed temporal bone biopsy under general anesthesia. An incision was made on the post-auricular scar from previous surgery. When the periosteum flap was created, an unexpected massive serous leakage was encountered, spouting from abnormal pores or lytic lesions in the temporal bone (Fig. ), which were similar to those described in previous reports []. Part of the temporal bone appeared blue in color, suggesting resorption. Samples were quickly collected from the bone surrounding the pores, and serous leakage (which appeared to be CSF) was stopped using fibrin glue and absorbable hemostat. There are no signs of recurrence of cholesteatoma at that time. Histopathological analysis revealed abnormal bony structures and accompanying small slits lined by epithelial cells (Fig. ). The findings ruled out other diagnoses, and were supportive of a diagnosis of Gorham Stout Disease in conjunction with the clinical and radiographic information. We concluded that the progressive osteolysis was far more likely to have been caused by Gorham-Stout disease rather than cholesteatoma. Skull base reconstruction was abandoned as osteolysis was considered to be progressive. Conservative treatment with infectious control was implemented as an alternative.\nDuring the first year of follow-up, he suffered a mild headache on one occasion, leading to an unscheduled visit. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics at an outpatient clinic to prevent the development of severe meningitis. At this point, no apparent CSF leakage was observed, no hospitalization was required and his headache had resolved within a few days. After that, there was no need to visit the hospital, except for follow-up once every few months. He was followed every two or 3 months for the next 1 year, during which time there were no signs of CSF or cholesteatoma recurrence.\nWe think that he has little risk of recurrence of the cholesteatoma because there has been no clear evidence of recurrence of cholesteatoma since the age of 18. However, this is an extremely rare case. CT imaging with three-dimensional reconstruction has been taken in every six months to assess the progression of osteolysis of the temporal or other bones of the skull and to watch out recurrent cholesteatoma. He remained well at the time of his last follow up. His quality of life has been maintained.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Persistent orocutaneous fistula'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Plasmacytoma enucleated from the medial side of the left mandible 3 years ago'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': '3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Orococutaneous fistula', 'Type': 'Complication of previous surgery', 'Location': 'Medial side of the left mandible'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Use of submandibular gland as pedicled flap to fill the defect', 'Details': 'Excision of fistula, preparation of healthy soft tissues, mobilization and rotation of submandibular gland, closure of oral and cutaneous sites'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Ideal closure of the fistula observed'}}}"
"A 73-year-old lady presented with a fall down of 13 stairs at her home while intoxicated. Her past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and degenerative lumbar spinal disease. She was a lifelong smoker who was independent in her daily activities. She presented to her local hospital with symptoms of neck pain and stiffness but denied any chest pain. She was hemodynamically stable and underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan. The scan revealed no obvious vertebral fractures but did reveal a focal pseudoaneurysm along the left lateral wall of the aortic arch between the origins of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries (\n). This measured 19 mm in maximum anteroposterior dimension. She was subsequently referred to the vascular surgical team, who agreed to manage her conservatively with yearly CT scans.\nEleven months later, the patient represented to her local hospital with sudden onset of chest pain radiating to her back. Initial observations were unremarkable. A repeat CT of the aorta demonstrated the aneurysm with no significant size increase compared with the previous CT scan. The vascular surgical team felt that an endovascular approach would not be suitable owing to the proximity of the lesion to the head and neck vessels. Transthoracic echocardiogram and coronary angiography were normal.\nThe patient underwent surgery via a median sternotomy. The aortic arch and the head and neck vessels were dissected. The pseudoaneurysm was identified and appeared isolated to the greater curve on the left lateral aspect of the arch (\n). Following full heparinization, cardiopulmonary bypass was established by cannulation of the ascending aorta and the right atrium at a temperature of 35°C. The base of the aneurysm was approximated using several 3/0 prolene pledgeted mattress sutures from the outside, with reduced flow facilitating the closure (\n). A needle was inserted into the excluded part of the aneurysm to ensure there was no persistent flow. The bypass time was 27 minutes. The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. She was extubated on the same day and discharged home on the 5th postoperative day. She was reviewed in the outpatient follow-up clinic for 6 months and then at 1 year postoperatively. She was doing very well with no chest or back pain. A repeat CT scan at 6 months revealed an isolated saccular aneurysm which no longer filled with contrast (\n). The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta were normal. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal biventricular function and a normal sized aortic root.","{

"A male patient aged 37 years visited the local hospital and planned to undergo botulinum toxin injection to relieve spasticity and dystonia of his left upper limb 3 years after subarachnoid hemorrhage. His past medical history revealed the fact that he had been affected by dystonia and spasticity in his left upper limb, especially the hand, secondary to tuberculous meningitis at the age of 3. The patient reported that for decades his left upper limb muscle strength was normal, however, it decreased to fair grade after the subarachnoid hemorrhage with worsening of dystonic and spastic symptom.\nThe degree of spasticity before the treatment was Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) 2 in upper arm flexor muscles. The patient received a total of 200 U of onabotulinum toxin A (Botox): 100 U each into the left biceps brachii muscle and the brachialis muscle to relieve spasticity. Guiding techniques such as the ultrasound or electromyography were not used, but no complications were noted during injection. Electrical stimulation therapy was applied to the treated muscle, and the patient stretched his arm repeatedly to improve the range of motion. He performed exercises of the arm and shoulders at least 3 hours daily at a higher intensity than usual. During the exercise, there was no discomfort, and later, he increased exercise intensity. However, 3 days later, progressive edema and pain occurred in the left upper limb and he was transferred to our hospital the next day. He had no history of trauma except the stretching exercise, with no history of previous cardiovascular or other hemorrhagic diseases. He did not take drugs that affecting blood coagulation tendency. There were no known drug allergies. The thrombophilia profile was negative except for the mildly elevated D-dimer concentration (2.2 μg/mL) ().\nThe strength of the left shoulder flexor and extensor muscle at the time of visiting our clinic was fair grade (manual muscle test, 3/5). The spasticity of the upper arm flexor muscle was identified as MAS 1+. Physical examination revealed edema, heat and tenderness of the left upper extremity (). No sign of a local infection or tenderness was observed in the area of BoNT-A injection conducted 4 days back. The circumferences measured bilaterally at 5 cm above medial epicondyle were 33.5 cm on right and 37.6 cm on left, respectively. Given the patient’s symptoms, DVT was suspected, and thus, Doppler ultrasonography was performed. The results revealed the presence of DVT at the lower region of the left brachial and axillary veins (). In addition, venous computed tomography (CT) angiography was conducted to identify the distribution of thrombosis. Thus, the thrombus was observed from the lower region of internal jugular vein including the brachiocephalic and the axillary veins ().\nThe patient was placed in a sling to immobilize the arm and anticoagulation therapy was initiated with rivaroxaban (Xarelto; 15 mg twice daily per oral). After 1 week, compressive therapy was combined using compression bandage with icepack to reduce febrile sensation and edema. The edema in the upper extremity improved with time and the pain with febrile sensation disappeared.\nAt the 2-week follow-up, the patient had no pain or swelling. CT performed one month later revealed the resolution of filling defect with only small residual thrombosis in the brachiocephalic vein (). To reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT, rivaroxaban (Xarelto) was continued at the dosage of 20 mg once daily for 6 months.","{

"A 45-year-old man presented to our clinic with a left knee injury that had occurred a few days before while skiing. He had been immobilized in a brace at the local medical office.\nClinical examination showed marked swelling of the knee joint, with pain at passive mobilization and restricted active motion: 40° of active flexion and an inability to actively extend the knee. Weight-bearing was hardly possible. There was an obvious gap at the level of the insertion of the patellar tendon on the lower pole of the patella. Testing of the MCL compared to the healthy side showed >10 mm widening of the medial joint line with valgus stress in 30° of flexion as well as in full extension. There was no clinical evidence of instability of the other knee ligaments.\nThe X-ray of the injured knee showed a superior migration of the patella compared to its usual position (). An MRI-scan confirmed the clinical suspicion of a complete tear of the MCL next to its proximal insertion on the medial femoral condyle, as well as a complete rupture of the patellar tendon at the level of its insertion on the lower pole of the patella. There were no lesions of the cruciate ligaments and menisci ().\nThe medical history revealed lower back pain due to a herniated disc, which had been treated conservatively. The patient also reported some pain episodes at the level of the left patellar tendon while jogging in the past. No specific treatment was prescribed for these pains.\nOur patient was operated on under epidural anesthesia 5 days after his accident. Clinical examination under anaesthesia confirmed once again the complete instability of the MCL with valgus stress without laxity in the other plains of motion.\nAt first, we approached the patellar tendon through an anterior longitudinal midline incision. After debridement of the tendinous tissue at the level of the tear, a Krackow-stitch was placed in the patellar tendon distally to its tear. The two loops of this stitch were passed through two bony tunnels in the patella and sutured to each other at the proximal pole of the patella. At the level of the tear, the transosseous reinsertion was reinforced by a running suture of a 3/0 wire. As there was a history of pain at the patellar tendon, we decided to reinforce the reinsertion of the tendon with an allograft of fascia lata, which was sutured directly to the tendinous tissue with absorbable stitches.\nThe tear of the MCL was approached via an oblique medial incision. At first we performed a direct suture which was reinforced with an autograft of the homolateral semitendinosus tendon. The semitendinosus was isolated with an open stripper, taking care to preserve its distal insertion on the tibia. After suturing it to the MCL, the autograft was fixed proximally with a staple at the level of the medial femoral condyle and distally with a direct suture to its original insertion in order to obtain a double-loop reinforcement. The staple fixation was done in a position of 30° knee flexion and slight varus.\nPostoperatively the knee was immobilized in 10° of flexion in a synthetic plaster cast with partial weight-bearing allowed. After 3 weeks the knee was placed in a brace with progressive flexion: 30° the first week, 60° the second week, and 90° the last week. After 6 weeks the brace was removed and complete flexion allowed. A rehabilitation programme with progressive mobilization, proprioceptive training, and muscle strengthening exercises was started.\nClinical control 3 months after the operation showed a limitation of flexion of 20° compared to the other side. There was no swelling of the knee but evident atrophy of the quadriceps muscle without limitation of active extension. Mediolateral stability testing showed no residual valgus instability. A bilateral X-ray of the knee showed normal height of the patella.\nAt 6 months, full motion was recovered and the patient had returned to normal daily life and recreational sports activities (cycling, fitness). Due to discomfort at the level of the medial femoral condyle, the staple fixing the semitendinosus autograft was removed at 9 months. After this removal, no medial instability occurred. At final follow-up 18 months after the injury, the patient was symptom-free and he had returned to skiing, protecting his knee with a brace.","{

"A 15-year-old female with a prior history of aborted cardiac death and surgical correction of anomalous origin of the RCA was referred to the cardiology department due to repeated aborted sudden cardiac death after physical exertion with boxing. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (). Biphasic 200 joules defibrillation restored the heart to sinus rhythm and cardiopulmonary function recovered without neurologic sequelae. Two years prior to this event, she experienced chest discomfort followed by aborted sudden cardiac death after heavy exercise for the first time. Initial ECG at the emergency room showed pulseless electrical activity. She was successfully resuscitated after basic life support maneuvers and fully recovered with hypothermic treatment after being admitted to the emergency department. Her family history of structural heart disease, syncope or sudden cardiac death was unremarkable. Several cardiac examinations were performed at that time. Echocardiography demonstrated no structural heart disease with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Cardiac computed tomography revealed anomalous origin of the RCA from the left coronary cusp coursing between the pulmonary artery and the aorta (). Her follow-up ECGs after stabilization showed a sinus rhythm with an inverted T wave and a prolonged QT interval which was suggestive of congenital LQTS (). She was not taking any medications which can prolong the QT interval and laboratory findings did not show electrolyte abnormalities. But this finding was overlooked and anomalous origin of the RCA was provisionally considered as the cause of the aborted cardiac arrest. She underwent surgery to re-implant the anomalous RCA from the left to the right sinus of Valsalva. After receiving surgical correction of anomalous origin of the RCA, she had been doing well before the second event of aborted cardiac death developed. Coronary angiogram with a provocation test using ergonovine was done after the second event, and it revealed no significant abnormalities and the re-implantation site of the RCA ostium was intact. An electrophysiologic study was performed to rule out possible causes of other arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest. However no other arrhythmia was induced and also polylmorphic ventricular tachycardia was not inducible with programmed stimulation. The ECG after restoring the heart to sinus rhythm showed still significant prolongation of the QT interval, resulting in the diagnosis of LQTS, probably type I, regarding her clinical presentation, even though the ECG pattern showed a prolonged QT interval and a notched T wave suggesting LQTS type 2. Gene studies were recommended, but declined by her family. ECGs of her parents showed no significant QT prolongation. Medication with a β-blocker (atenolol) was started and the dose was titrated up to 1.3 mg/kg (50 mg bid, regarding her body weight; 78 kg). A follow-up exercise tolerance test revealed blunting of the heart rate response during maximal exertion and she was instructed to avoid heavy exercise. She remained free from ventricular arrhythmias while she was on a β-blocker medication during the follow-up of more than 6 months. Her serial follow-up ECGs showed significant QTc prolongation of >500 ms consistently.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Right shoulder and arm pain, swelling, and deformity following work accident'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Accidental fall resulting in anterior dislocation of the shoulder and transverse fracture of the humeral shaft'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiograph', 'Finding': 'Anterior dislocation of the shoulder with transverse fracture of the humeral shaft'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Dislocation of the shoulder with humeral shaft fracture', 'Type': 'Traumatic injury', 'Location': 'Right shoulder and humeral shaft'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical stabilization of the humeral shaft fracture', 'Details': 'Closed reduction of the dislocated shoulder followed by intramedullary nailing and antirotational plate fixation'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Bone union achieved four months postoperatively, hardware removal after 12 months with full recovery of shoulder function', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Three years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Painless shoulder with full range of motion'}}}"
"The patient was a 15-year-old male child belonging to an urban, middle socioeconomic class, who was living with his father; his mother had abandoned him as a child. He presented to the department of psychiatry with his father, who reported that the child had frequently run away from home in the past three to four years; he had started behaving differently and had shown decreased social interest, irritability, and persistent sadness of mood for the past two to three months. The father reported that after the patients' most recent disappearance from home, he had been contacted by police officials of another state one month after the patient had run away; they had informed him that the patient was at a childcare facility and could be picked up from there. The patient described that after he had run away, he would assume the identity of an 18-year-old Mr. S, who was an electrician. During subsequent interviews, patients described an unusual experience where he had found himself to be floating outside his own body while he visualized his own body from a third-person perspective. This incident had occurred during one of his fugue states in another city; he described being inside a hospital room with doctors who were questioning him about his current state. Later, he had felt like someone else had occupied his body and his soul had left his body and floated up to the ceiling and was completely detached from his body; from his visuospatial angle, he had been able to visualize his own body, which had been very clear while the parasomatic body had not been well defined and he could only see its hands, He had tried tirelessly to reach back to his original self but had been unable to do so. He had seen his body being interviewed by the doctors to whom his parasomatic image tried to reach out, but he had little control over its movement and kept on floating. This episode had only lasted for a short period of time, about 10-15 minutes as estimated by the patient, during which he had remained in the air observing his original self and in very little control of the parasomatic body. The original self had been replying briefly to the interviewers as per the patient as he described it was not him who was in control of his original self.\nThe patient’s past history revealed that he had fled from his residence on three occasions previously, but he did not remember the reason for fleeing. His medical history was negative for symptoms of epilepsy, migraine, syncope, cerebrovascular accident, neurological deficit, etc. There was no history of episodes of hyperpyrexia warranting admission. No psychiatric illness or substance dependence was present in the family. His mother had left home when he had been a year old. His upbringing was done by his father. He was living in a joint family and as per the patient, the relations between family members were not congenial. Also, as per the patient, his father was very aggressive and short-tempered, and frequently hit him brutally, and he had sustained multiple injuries as well. This was why he frequently ran away, according to the patient.\nPersonal history revealed that the patient had been a full-term normal delivery with appropriate developmental milestones. The patient had speech disorder in the form of lisping since childhood and had traits conforming to conduct disorder, such as bullying young children and threatening them, behaving deceitfully, lying, and manipulating people to obtain favors, episodes of truancy from school, staying outside beyond home curfew, etc. He had a prior relationship with three girls, of which his father had not approved, and those had been short-lasting. He had fallen foul of the law during his time away from home, and he had spent few months in a correctional facility for juveniles in Gujarat, India. After corroboration from reliable informants and patient interviews, substance use was ruled out; also, the patient did not display any features of substance withdrawal during his inpatient stay. Premorbid personality assessment revealed that he was an introvert, optimistic regarding new situations, short-tempered, and self-dependent.\nVitals including temperature were unremarkable, ruling out hyperpyrexia. No other abnormality was detected during general and systemic examinations; an otorhinolaryngology opinion was also sought to rule out vestibular defects, which could contribute to OBEs. During the serial mental status examination, a rapport was built with the patient and he revealed that the lack of a mother and harsh parenting by his father had led to him to a state of persistent stress and he wished that this fugue-like state would end and described a feeling of helplessness and persistent sadness, which was also evident in his affect. He did not have any delusions or hallucinations and denied any change in sense of agency routinely. His speech was appropriate with a slight lisp, and his psychomotor activity was normal. Cognitive tests were unremarkable and appropriate to age. Baseline investigations including hemogram, liver, and renal function tests were within normal limits. Electroencephalography (EEG) did not reveal any abnormality. CT scan of the brain did not show any pathological findings.\nA diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative fugue was formulated along with secondary depression as per the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). His Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale-II (A-DES) score was 118/300 (suggestive of moderate dissociative experience) on initial assessment. Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale (KADS) was used to assess depressive symptoms; the patient scored 9, which suggested possible depression. The neuropsychological assessment involved IQ assessment, and the Rorschach test was suggestive of depressive and anxiety disorder but no psychotic features. As a therapeutic modality, abreaction was performed using a guided interview along with injecting 1 mg Intravenous lorazepam after obtaining written consent from the patient and his guardian. He had another OBE during his interview, which was similar to the previous one. During the interview, he slipped into a trance-like state and gave brief answers. He stated as follows: “below me, I saw my body, from outside lying on bed and the doctor standing near me was asking some questions.” His voice was changed, his lisping was absent, and his tone was loud, and within few seconds, he started shouting but later calmed down within a few minutes. After the abreaction, his stress symptoms and depression improved. Escitalopram was initiated at a dose of 10 mg, which was titrated up to 15 mg in four weeks along with clonazepam 0.25 twice a day. Abreaction, hypnosis, and relaxation training along with supportive psychotherapy were provided to the patient in a structured format. His father was psycho-educated about his illness and was briefed about interpersonal conflict management. After four weeks of inpatient management, the symptoms of dissociation and the OBE phenomenon resolved. The patient was followed up for the next six months and did not report any further dissociative state or OBE.","{

"A 30-year-old female reported to orthopedic outpatient department with pain and swelling just above the right ankle joint and another swelling over the right iliac region for last 6 months. The patient had a surgery for the swelling of distal right leg 18 months ago by general orthopedic surgeon. Review of surgical records revealed that she was operated for a lytic lesion in distal tibia with preliminary diagnosis of benign bone lesion without preoperative biopsy. Curettage of the lesion was performed along with filling of surgical cavity with autologous bone grafts harvested from the right iliac crest. Histopathology revealed benign GCT of distal tibia. Below knee plaster was kept for 4 months postoperatively. Two months after the removal of plaster, she developed pain in the right leg just above the ankle, along with gradually increasing swelling. Two weeks later, she noticed another swelling over the right iliac crest, associated with mild pain and discomfort. The patient was finally referred to our oncologic clinic. The patient was clinically anemic. There was a swelling over the anterolateral aspect of distal part of right leg with painful restricted ankle movements and another swelling over the right iliac region with mild to moderate tenderness on palpation on both sites.\nPlain X-rays showed lytic lesion in distal tibia with ill defined margins without any evidence of pathological fracture. X-ray of right iliac wing showed large soft tissue mass with irregularity of the bone over the outer table of iliac crest []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pelvis and distal tibia was done to delineate the extent of tumor and its extension [Figures and ]. Technetium-99 bone scan showed increased uptake around distal tibia and focally in the ipsilateral iliac region only at the graft harvest site and no additional foci in the body (i.e. ruling out metachronous lesions elsewhere). Core needle biopsy was performed at both sites to confirm the microscopic/tissue diagnosis. The histopathology revealed benign GCT at both sites with identical picture. Computed tomography of the lungs was normal.\nThe patient was taken up for planned surgery under spinal anesthesia after taking informed consent. Distal tibial lesion was widely resected and reconstruction was done with medialization of fibula and fixing it on the dome of talus and in the distal medullary canal of the resected tibia with Kirscher's wires. Wide resection of iliac wing along with soft tissue mass was performed. The iliac swelling was confined to soft tissue underneath the scar with irregularity over iliac crest. The histopathology of both sites reconfirmed GCT.\nPostoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged with a long leg cast for 4 months. Then, partial weight bearing was started with crutches. Patient achieved restoration of bone continuity with union at both ends. Hypertrophy of the grafted fibula was observed and patient was mobile with full unprotected weight bearing on the operated leg after 1 year. Two years after surgery, the patient was symptom free and walking without any aid and with no evidence of recurrence at both sites and no metachronous lesions or pulmonary metastasis. Fibula showed good hypertrophy and the iliac region healed well [].","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Missing right side ear due to road traffic accident'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Lost ear due to previous surgical attempt for reconstruction'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans', 'Finding': 'Assessment of implant positions and proximity to anatomical structures'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Missing ear', 'Type': 'Aesthetic deformity', 'Location': 'Right side'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Custom silicone auricular prosthesis supported by two dental implants', 'Details': 'Placement of dental implants, design and fabrication of custom healing abutments and titanium bar framework for prosthesis support'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No adverse reactions during 4-week follow-up with PEEK abutments', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved aesthetics and regained ear functionality'}}}"
"A 74-year-old female patient presented with the feeling of an abdominal growing mass and weight loss (approximatively 10 kg within the last 12 months) without rectal bleeding or abdominal pain. After a computed tomography (CT) scan the patient was referred to our hospital with the suspicion of a rectal tumor. Complex medical history included a subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy and a mucous fistula at the descending colon due to Crohn disease at the age of 16 years. In the following years, the patient suffered from repeated ileus episodes and a laparotomy with adhesiolysis was performed in 2007. She never took any medication for her Crohn disease and no further manifestations of activity were observed. Clinical examination showed the patient in reduced general condition; the abdomen was soft and there was no pain during the palpation of the abdominal wall. Laboratory values were in the standard range.\nThe imaging in the CT scan was not conclusive, and therefore we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the suspicion of tumor and to allow staging. The MRI showed a massive dilatation of the remaining colon and the rectum without detection of a tumor at the anal level (Fig. ). Lower endoscopy failed due to complete anal stenosis and obliteration of the descending colon at the stoma site.\nThe possible therapeutic options were discussed with the patient. She refused a restoration of the intestinal continuity so we decided to perform an abdominoperineal rectum resection. After laparotomy and adhesiolysis the whole sigma and rectum appeared massively dilated (Fig. ). The rectosigmoid was resected until reaching the muscular pelvic floor. The ileostomy was newly created after resecting the approximatively last 5 cm of the ileum because of a prolapse. The anus was dissected carefully intersphincterically and the specimen was removed completely (Fig. ). The perineum was closed tension free.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged to rehabilitation on the 13th postoperative day. The pathology report showed a dilated rectum and sigma with large amounts of partly calcified mucus. There was no evidence of dysplasia, malignancy, or Crohn manifestation in the completely obliterated proximal colon and the anus.","{

"A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history of lupus presented for elective left total knee arthroplasty following the development of osteoarthritis that had failed conservative measures. The patient had a history of previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system []. She underwent removal of the tibial WasherLoc approximately 10 years later, in the early 2000's ().\nThe patient was positioned supine; standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was then performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was placed and noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. At this time, it was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was then placed back on the femur and was noted to be in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The bone mulch screw was located and identified in the lateral femoral condyle; a curette was used to clear the head of the screw, and it was removed. The proximal tibia was then prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; the knee was noted to be tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. It was noted at this time while trying to trial the prostheses that the lateral femoral condyle was fractured. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted. The femoral canal was reamed, and the femoral box cut was made. However, during trialing, the medial femoral condyle was now noted to have a fracture as well. An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were then reamed to accept a 200 mm × 9 mm intramedullary nail to act as a temporary internal stabilization device (). The knee was irrigated and closed, and the patient was admitted to the floor. The patient was then brought back to the OR on postoperative day 3 following the index procedure. The prior incision was utilized; the wound was copiously irrigated. It was noted that due to the patient's poor bone quality and comminution of the fractures that the only viable option was a distal femoral replacement. The distal femur was resected, the femoral canal was reamed, and a planar was used on the distal femur. A skim cut and reaming of the tibia were performed. The components were trialed. Final implants included a 13 × 127 mm hinged femoral prosthesis and small 1-stemmed tibial tray; a 32 mm patellar component was used, and a size 10 polyethylene was then inserted; all components were cemented. The knee was noted to be stable throughout range of motion with good patellofemoral tracking. The surgical wound was copiously irrigated and closed (). Estimated blood loss was 100 mL; no postoperative transfusion was necessary. She was able to bear weight as tolerated immediately postoperatively. The patient's pain was controlled postoperatively, and she worked well with physical therapy and was discharged home with home health care on postoperative day two with 3 weeks of Coumadin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\nThe first postoperative visit was at two weeks; the patient had some swelling and quadriceps weakness, and the incision was healing well. Range of motion (ROM) was from 0-100°. At 6 weeks, she was still requiring narcotic medication; quadriceps strength was improving, ROM from 0-105°.\nAt 12 weeks, X-rays remained unchanged; the patient continued to have mild quadriceps weakness and was no longer requiring narcotic medications. ROM was not documented at this visit. At 6 months, ROM was 0-120°. The incision was well healed; X-rays were unchanged. The patient was doing well; however, she continued to have some residual quadriceps weakness and difficulty ambulating long distances. The patient was lost to follow-up after 6 months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Patient presented with atrophy and weakness of the left forearm, pain in the left hand, and a pulsatile mass in the medial left upper arm'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousConditions': ['Diabetes', 'Hypertension', 'Coronary artery disease', 'Chronic kidney disease']}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Pseudoaneurysm of the left brachial artery'}, {'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Significant osteopenia in the hand'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type II', 'Type': 'Neurological disorder', 'Location': 'Left upper extremity'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative treatment measures', 'Details': 'Pharmacologic intervention, occupational therapy, stellate ganglion blocks'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Unsuccessful'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient deceased as a result of sequelae from a respiratory infection'}}}"
"A right hand dominant, 28-year-old Caucasian male presented to the orthopedic associates of Southwest Ohio as a referral to a hand specialist due to an abnormal ultrasound finding and left wrist mass. The ultrasound of the suspected left wrist mass was executed 10 days prior, exhibiting increased echogenicity within the musculature of the left distal wrist at the site of the patient’s reported abnormality. This echogenicity was asymmetric when compared to the right wrist. The image of the left anterior distal forearm on ultrasound is displayed in . There was no evidence of a focal mass or fluid collection according to the ultrasound report. The patient presented complaining of left wrist swelling, with no pain. There was an unremarkable past medical, surgical, or family history significant to the chief complaint. As far as a differential, the questionable echogenicity within the musculature of the left distal forearm could have been related to a mild non-specific myositis. Moreover, there was no evidence of focal mass or fluid collection, so an MRI was considered to rule out a neoplasm.\nThe patient completed the MRI in 10 days, and then followed up in a week to the clinic. The current status of the patient remained unchanged. The MRI of the patient demonstrated a palpable abnormality secondary to a congenital variation consisting of a PL muscle variant due to an accessory muscle belly volar to the flexor tendons. The signal intensity of this muscle appears within normal limits. This finding was confirmed on the retrospective review of the prior ultrasound. The abnormal muscle variant is displayed in the sagittal view T1 MRI in (), it is displayed in the coronal view T1 MRI in (), and it is displayed in the coronal view T2 MRI in ().\nAfter consecutive diagnostic imaging techniques ruled out anything pathologic including neoplasm, the patient was counseled on the plan. Since the muscle variant was not painful and it did not limit functional outcomes, a non-operative conservative plan was instituted. The patient was informed to follow-up as needed, and if any concerning symptoms arose to schedule an appointment and new measures would be taken for continued care.\nIn the present case, the PL muscle belly originated at the distal forearm volar to the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis tendons. The abnormality lied between the soft tissue markers placed at the site of the patient’s complaint of the palpable abnormality.","{

The knee was irrigated and closed, and the patient was admitted to the floor. The patient was then brought back to the OR on postoperative day 3 following the index procedure. The prior incision was utilized; the wound was copiously irrigated. It was noted that due to the patient's poor bone quality and comminution of the fractures that the only viable option was a distal femoral replacement. The distal femur was resected, the femoral canal was reamed, and a planar was used on the distal femur. A skim cut and reaming of the tibia were performed. The components were trialed. Final implants included a 13 × 127 mm hinged femoral prosthesis and small 1-stemmed tibial tray; a 32 mm patellar component was used, and a size 10 polyethylene was then inserted; all components were cemented. The knee was noted to be stable throughout range of motion with good patellofemoral tracking. The surgical wound was copiously irrigated and closed (). Estimated blood loss was 100 mL; no postoperative transfusion was necessary. She was able to bear weight as tolerated immediately postoperatively. The patient's pain was controlled postoperatively, and she worked well with physical therapy and was discharged home with home health care on postoperative day two with 3 weeks of Coumadin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\nThe first postoperative visit was at two weeks; the patient had some swelling and quadriceps weakness, and the incision was healing well. Range of motion (ROM) was from 0-100°. At 6 weeks, she was still requiring narcotic medication; quadriceps strength was improving, ROM from 0-105°.\nAt 12 weeks, X-rays remained unchanged; the patient continued to have mild quadriceps weakness and was no longer requiring narcotic medications. ROM was not documented at this visit. At 6 months, ROM was 0-120°. The incision was well healed; X-rays were unchanged. The patient was doing well; however, she continued to have some residual quadriceps weakness and difficulty ambulating long distances. The patient was lost to follow-up after 6 months.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe right ankle pain and inability to bear weight after jumping into a lake', 'Significant swelling of the ankle with global tenderness to palpation', 'Limited ankle motion in all planes'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Right tibial stress fracture with intramedullary nail fixation 14 months prior'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Finding': 'Dislocated fibula posterior to the tibia, posterior dislocation of the talus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Fibular dislocation', 'Type': 'Traumatic injury', 'Location': 'Ankle joint'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Open reduction and internal fixation of the fibular dislocation', 'Details': 'Reduction of fibula with Kirschner wire and quadricortical screws fixation'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Stable fixation at 3 months postoperatively', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Limited to 10 degrees of plantar flexion with full strength'}}}"
"A 78-year-old Japanese woman, who had undergone several laparotomies in the past, including an open drainage and sigmoidectomy because of peritonitis and colon cancer resection, underwent a curative bladder resection for bladder cancer via an extraperitoneal approach. On the third postoperative day (POD), a dirty brown discharge was noticed in a surgical drainage tube placed in the postbladder space, associated with a high fever and severe abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed fluid collection around a small bowel loop in the pelvis and in the upper abdomen (Figure ). Urgent exploration through a midline incision revealed an injury 5 mm long in the small bowel injury at the base of the pelvis. Because of the presence of severe intestinal adhesions from the previous repeated surgeries, it as not possible to perform adequate bowel dissection for enterectomy and anastomosis, thus the intestinal injury was simply closed by a layer to layer suture.\nAfter this second surgery, no fever elevation or discharge was noted, thus oral feeding was started on 11 days after the first surgery (eight days after the second), as abdominal radiography had not shown any evidence of obstruction or ileus. However, during that night, the patient had a sudden elevation in temperature and enteral drainage from the midline incision was seen. Computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed fluid collection and our patient was therefore prepared for further surgery. During the operation, adhesive bands between intestinal loops were dissected apart, the perforated bowel was removed, and intestinal continuity was reestablished via an end to end anastomosis. This operation took almost 10 hours, with estimated blood loss of 576 ml leading to marked tissue edema.\nAfter this third operation, our patient's temperature was normal, but her small bowel was seen to be distended on abdominal radiographs. Contrast examination of the bowel performed on day 21 after the first surgery (day nine after the third surgery) revealed that the passage of contrast medium was poor, but it was unclear whether there was a leak (Figure ). After the examination, our patient experienced sudden abdominal pain and nausea. The following day, enteric drainage was again seen from the midline wound. Radiolography revealed that the contrast medium that had been administered orally the previous day was present in the extraperitoneal drain discharge (Figure ). CT also demonstrated the presence of extraluminal contrast medium (Figure ).\nWe considered it necessary to perform another intervention to close the intestinal injury; however, we concluded that a fourth surgery presented a high risk for this patient. Thus, we decided to treat her conservatively. For decompression and drainage of the intestine, a jejunostomy tube was thought to be necessary, and a percutaneous approach considered the best option. After we obtained our patient's informed consent, PEG-j tube (Transgastric Jejunal Catheter Kit with Funada style fixture; Create Medic Co. Ltd, Yokohama, Japan) was placed as described below.\nEndoscopy was performed to identify a site of insertion for the tube by translumination and palpation of the abdominal wall. Under local anesthesia, the fixture was inserted into the stomach percutaneously via the anterior wall of the stomach. Through the first needle, an endoscopic snare was inserted into the gastric lumen. The suture was then fed out of the second needle into the loop (Figure ). The fixture was extracted and the suture ligated on the outside of the abdominal wall (Figure ). After raising the stomach to appose the abdominal wall, four sutures were placed around the site at which the gastrojejunostomy tube would be inserted (Figure ). A 16F enteric tube was inserted into the jejunum percutaneously (Figure ). Finally, the apex of the gastrojejunostomy tube was placed at the upper jejunum 1100 mm from the stomach (Figure ). No complications or delayed wound infections were experienced.\nA somatostatin analog was administered subcutaneously twice daily, and a proton pump inhibitor was administered intravenously once daily. The discharge from the gastrojejunostomy tube decreased dramatically from 500 ml to 120 ml per day (Figure ), and amylase was not found in the abdominal drain. The PEG-j tube did not limit the activity of our patient. Radiological enteroclysis performed 22 days after the PEG-j tube placement showed not only an absence leakage but also recovery of intestinal flow and a normal gas pattern (Figure ). After confirming that no leakage was present, oral feeding was started two days later (24 days after the PEG-j tube placement). After the PEG-j tube was removed, our patient was discharged, tolerating a regular diet and in good condition.","{

"The present case report is about a 25-year-old male, who had suffered a fall from a height in jungle and traumatic amputation of his left hand with remains of forearm amputated stump.\nPatient had no any past medical or surgical history. Patient had no similar family history.\nSuspecting the involvement of wild animals, patient was given anti rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin according to the WHO protocol. He also had suffered a sub arachnoid hemorrhage and was managed conservatively as advised by our neurosurgery department.\nAs for the amputated hand, high end prosthesis was advised for the patient but being from very poor background it was far beyond his budget. A man who depends entirely on daily wages and manual labor to feed himself and his family, losing the functionality of one hand was devastating and depressing for him. The main problem that presented before us was not only to stabilize him, but also allow him to get back into the society with gratitude and without having to depend on others for his daily chores and financial needs. Considering all these factors, Krukenberg operation was planned for him. Although this surgery is seldom done and even not recommended by many surgeons but it was currently the best available option for him. He was explained in detail about the procedure and extent of functionality he could attain. Videos and photographs were shown to further elucidate the whole process. Earlier the patient and relative were reluctant for the procedure but they had given the consent for the same.\nThe classical procedure described by Swanson and Swanson was followed with few modifications. A longitudinal incision was made on the flexor surface of the forearm. A similar incision on the dorsal surface slightly toward the ulnar side was made. The forearm muscles were separated into two groups and were resected in order to reduce the size of the stump.\nPronator teres was conserved as it is the main operating muscle. Hence all precautions were taken to maintain the integrity of the muscle. Hemostasis was secured. Skin edges were opposed and sutured. Post operative period was without complications. Regular dressing was done and physiotherapy was given so that the patient started using the pincers. Patient was regularly motivated. Help from the psychiatry department was taken to help him cope with his depression.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Urinary incontinence', 'Lower abdominal discomfort'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Appendectomy 22 years ago'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Heterogeneously enhanced mass nearby the uterus and right ovary'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': '8 cm-sized enhancing mass attached to right adnexa and uterus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Subserosal uterine leiomyoma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Pelvic cavity'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Exploratory laparotomy', 'Details': 'Excision of retroperitoneal tumor attached to right surface of uterus'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Symptoms resolved, no evidence of recurrent leiomyoma'}}}"
"A 25-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic with a complaint of recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek of three-month duration. He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region. We suspected the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. A periapical view was then taken with gutta-percha inserted into the sinus for foreign body localization purpose. The radiograph revealed the gutta-percha pointed towards the site of titanium plate and screws placed used for rigid fixation, and with the molar orthodontic tube appliance in its vicinity (). A cone beam CT was performed to provide a 3D detailed location of the appliance (Figures and ) and confirmed it to be located outside the maxillary antrum.\nThe presence of the molar orthodontic tube foreign body reaction was suspected as the most probable cause of the recurrent right cheek pain and swelling associated with an intraoral discharging sinus. Exploration of the site was performed through the sulcular incision under general anesthesia. The dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap. It was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. Just below it, one titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was inspected and found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone. However, a decision was made to remove them based on the fact that they are present in an infected area. (). The Le Fort I osteotomy site showed good healing with new bone formation. Patient had an uneventful recovery thereafter, and the orthognathic surgical team who attended him previously was informed of his progress.","{

"A 27-year-old man presented at the emergency department with massive hemorrhage from the tracheostomy tube. His was a case of multiple traumas due to a car accident that happened 8 month ago. He suffered a neck fracture that made him quadriplegic and was operated 8 month ago []. He had a nasogastric tube inserted and had a past history of discharge of food from the foramen of tracheostomy tube after oral feeding. Eight months after the tracheostomy intubation, massive bleeding was noted from the site of tracheostomy stoma and vital signs of the patient became unstable. His blood pressure was below 80/60 and the peripheral pulse was not palpable. As a result, an urgent surgery was performed on the patient under general anesthesia. The anesthetic agents were administered via the tracheostomy tube. We performed rigid bronchoscopy and observed tracheal stenosis from below the vocal cords. Because of the patient's critical health condition and severe tracheal stenosis, we could not have a clear view of the trachea. The tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) was placed in membranous part of trachea, behind the tracheostomy stoma. During the operation, the bleeding had stopped, which we concluded as the pressure of tracheostomy cuff. The site of tracheostomy stoma was dissected. The operation procedure included division and ligature of the innominate artery and separation of the trachea from the divided artery. The defect of trachea was repaired and reinforced with strap muscle [].\nThen, the tracheostomy tube was reinserted. Due to TEF, a jejunostomy tube was inserted in the patient. After the operation was over, vital signs of the patient were stabilized. The course of neurologic examination was not changed after the operation, but right radial pulse was found to be weaker than left radial pulse. The patient was discharged from hospital after 13 days. Two months later, the patient was again admitted to the hospital for the repair of TEF. Endoscopy was done on the patient. A large foramen in anterior wall of esophagus below the upper esophageal sphincter was shown.\nIn the course of hospital stay, the patient developed deep vein thrombosis in the left leg that progressed into the inferior vena cava. Heparin was administered to the patient with a dose of 1000 U/h through infusion pump. Colored Doppler sonography was performed after 7 days, which revealed that the deep vein thrombosis had resolved. Later, the patient developed severe purulent discharge from the tracheostomy tube. Chest X-ray showed bronchiectasis and pneumonia in both the lower pulmonary lobes of the lung. Appropriate treatment was started depending on the discharge culture result. Despite full antibiotic coverage, the condition of the patient gradually deteriorated. He developed septic shock that was unresponsive to the medical treatment. Unfortunately, our patient expired after 46 days of the first operation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Discomfort and pain in upper right molar area while biting'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Clinical and radiographic examination', 'Finding': 'Maxillary right second premolar and maxillary right first molar associated with severe chronic periodontitis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Severe chronic periodontitis', 'Type': 'Dental condition', 'Location': 'Maxillary right second premolar and first molar'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Autotransplantation and periodontal treatment', 'Details': 'Maxillary right second molar transplanted to maxillary right first molar space, followed by root canal therapy and regenerative periodontal surgery'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No clinical symptoms or radiographic signs of root resorption at 7-month follow-up', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '18 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Transplanted tooth restored with full crown, normal periodontal pocket depth, and no mobility'}}}"
"Initially, in late October 2013, a 93-year-old male presented with a six-month history of pain and swelling of the left ear. Clinical examination demonstrated a lesion along the posterior auricular sulcus with exposed cartilage within the depth of the lesion. Extending beyond this lesion was a region of erythema that suggested early involvement. There was no evidence of regional metastatic spread. A previous biopsy confirmed the lesion to be a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion was treated by surgical resection via a partial auriculectomy removing a 3 cm tumour. The deep surgical margin was positive, necessitating adjuvant radiation therapy. This was initially prescribed by the referring radiation oncologist with a hypofractionated regimen of 45 Gy in 15 fractions delivered daily using a single lateral electron field – 15 MeV with bolus. This hypofractionated lower dose regimen was originally pursued due to the advanced age of the patient. After the third fraction, the lesion had regrown to 3 cm, prompting an additional 15 Gy in six fractions as a concomitant boost for a total of 60 Gy in 21 fractions delivered over just 23 days, completed in January 2014. In April 2014, an irregular skin lining was noted within the treatment site, which was confirmed to be disease recurrence after a biopsy. A near-total auriculectomy sparing the lobe was performed, with final pathology showing a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and negative margins. Six months later in October 2014, a new squamous cell carcinoma was noted on the lobule of the remaining pinna, and a third completion auriculectomy was performed. Pathology revealed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with negative margins. Three months later, in January 2015, a recurrent mass developed at the base of the left auricle extending into the previous treatment site and the external ear canal with an invasion of the parotid gland (Figure ). The gross tumour volume was treated with 50 Gy in five fractions twice a week in 2.5 weeks. A high dose clinical target volume was not added and only a 2 mm circumferential expansion to the gross tumour volume was used for the final planning target volume. The suspicious erythematous area surrounding the gross tumor volume (GTV) received 40 Gy in five fractions concurrently as part of the same plan (Figure ). Within one month post-treatment, the tumour had completely regressed with no residual disease. No significant complications, such as bleeding or persistent or high-grade dermatitis, bone, or cartilaginous necrosis were noted.","{

"A 82-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of right sciatic nerve palsy and a mass in the right posterior thigh. Symptoms of sciatica had begun 6 months ago and then she visited another hospital and X-ray and MRI of the lumbar spine was performed. These showed slight canal stenosis of the lumbar spine. Although she was treated conservatively with medications, the symptoms worsened and sciatic nerve palsy resulted 3 weeks before visit to our hospital. Physical examination revealed a soft tissue mass of posterior thigh with pain and a drop foot with concomitant sensory loss. The patella tendon reflex was normal but Achilles tendon reflex was negative. The sensory exam and reflexes and manual muscle testing in the left leg were normal. All routine blood tests were normal. She had undergone partial gastrectomy 2 years ago. Resection was complete and TNM stage was T2b, N0, M0. The size of tumor was 8.5 x 8 cm and histological examination revealed the tumor was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with no regional lymph node metastasis. She didn’t receive adjuvant chemotherapy because of her age and her choice. Current Plain radiographs showed a radiolucent area in the posterior thigh without calcification and no changes in the femur. MRI (Figure ) showed the mass with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous high intensity on T2-weighted images and homogeneous high intensity on T1- weighted images with gadolinium enhancement was originated from sciatic nerve. We planed the surgical resection because her general condition was good and we confirmed local disease only, no evidence of another site of metastasis by CT. Surgical resection of the sciatic nerve mass was based on the assumption that the diagnosis was soft tissue sarcoma. Segmental resection of the sciatic nerve was performed because of complete paralysis and adequate margin. Intraoperative Macroscopic findings (Figure ) revealed the sciatic nerve was tightly surrounded by the mass and the mass strongly compressed the peripheral muscles. Histological examination (Figure ) showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which was the same as her primary site adenocarcinoma and invaded the sciatic nerve. Based on these findings, we diagnosed sciatic nerve palsy due to intraneural metastasis of gastric carcinoma. She can now walk with a short leg brace and cane. She is free of recurrence in the posterior thigh without chemotherapy and radiation and remains metastasis free after 1 year follow-up.","{

"A 53-year-old female patient who had been suffering for ten years from atypical facial pain combined with a partial facial spasm was referred to our outpatient clinic.\nShe presented with continuous distorsions of the mimic musculature in the region of the lower left lip, which had appeared following severe osteomyelitis of the left side of the mandible that had been treated surgically. For several weeks following the operation the patient experienced hypesthesia in the left mandibular region and skin. Thereafter, constant, disturbing spasms of the mimic musculature occurred combined with dyskinesia and deep spasmodic pain attacks located in her lower left lip region. In addition, a distinct cutaneous erythema appeared in the region of the dyskinesia (figure ).\nThe patient reported that pain attacks occurred daily immediately after awakening in the morning, continued during the day without any improvement and subsided only at bedtime.\nThere had been no satisfactory response to various neurological or dental therapy attempts nor to acupuncture. Only therapy with carbamazepine had brought a slight and transient relief of her symptoms.\nThe patient felt herself immensely restricted by her symptoms and was socially and professionally disabled. She had had to retire because of the intolerable pain attacks, and reported having suicidal thoughts from time to time.\nDuring the following years she detected alleviation points in her left hand and behind the left ear with which she was able to stop the convulsions and the pain as long as pressure was applied to the points (figure ).\nThe patient had had no history of movement disorders such as hemifacial spasms nor of allergy, smoking or alcoholism. She had no history of medication except for carbamazepine.\nOn physical examination, no anatomic disorders, infections or tumors were found except for a discrete septum deviation. We observed continuous spasms in the region of her left lower lip, accompanied by an intense eczema in this region. She was able to stop the spasms and the pain by pressing the points on her hand or behind the ear.\nAfter the patient had given informed consent, BTX-A-treatment was begun. She was treated over a period of 67 weeks with seven different injections of BTX-A at different time points.\nThe dose of BTX-A was increased from initially 5 units to 25 units at the seventh treatment. We also augmented the number of injection points from 2 points to 10 points in the affected area. Injections were made with 2.5 units per site (Botox®, Allergan Inc, Irvine, California; 0.1 ml = 2.5 units BTX-A). The time between the treatment sessions varied from 3 weeks to 24 weeks up to the last treatment. For details see table .\nBTX-A was injected into the inferior depressor labii muscle in the left lower lip region. The seventh injection with 25 units injected into 10 points was the most effective with an effect lasting 24 weeks (table ).\nThe patient was immediately pain-free after the injections and experienced other positive effects such as relief of spasms and eczema. The symptoms improved already after the first injection of botulinum toxin type A. At the check-up, three weeks after the first injection, the patient was free of symptoms and was very satisfied.\nAs agreed upon with the patient, she returned to our outpatient clinic for further treatment whenever any symptoms reappeared.\nThe BTX-A injection was repeated after 5 weeks with a total dose of 10 units at 4 injection points (4 injections à 2.5 units) because of mild spasms.\nAfter the second injection, the patient again experienced a reduction in pain, spasms and eczema for a period of 7 weeks, at which time we injected 15 units into 6 injection points.\nIn the further course, the patient returned four more times after 3, 11, 17 and 24 weeks for further injections with 20 to 25 units BTX-A into 8 to 10 injection sites. Fourteen weeks after the last series, she reported in a telephone interview that the excellent positive effects were long lasting and that she was not suffering from pain, spasms or eczema.\nThe patient was able to reduce the dose of carbamazepine considerably.\nIn the course of the treatment period, the duration of the symptom-free period increased from a minimum of 3 weeks to 24 weeks. The longest positive effect was seen after the injection of 25 units BTX-A into 10 injection points in the lower left lip region.\nThe patient did not note any side effects except for a slight leakage at the corner of her mouth lasting a few days, which she did not find very irritating as the positive benefits were much more important for her. A total follow-up period of 62 weeks was observed in this patient.\nIn summary, the patient expressed great satisfaction and stated: ""A completely new period in my life began"" after the first injection.","{

"Susan is a 51-year-old woman. As an adolescent, she developed scoliosis. Working as a hairstylist when she was 18 or 19, she began to have severe pain in her hands, making her work very difficult. She had carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand which provided temporary relief. Her symptoms slowly returned and she continued to have intense pain and difficulty with her daily activities. Seeking relief from her symptoms, she received treatment from chiropractors and Chinese medicine practitioners with no significant benefit. She also tried yoga and swimming but depending on the yoga movements or swimming strokes, she began to have more pain.\nWhen she was in her early forties, she began to have weakness in the lower half of her body. Her legs would frequently give out on the stairs, causing her to fall. Control of her bladder and bowel function also began to deteriorate. She had an MRI, and based on the results, she was scheduled for emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. She was informed that it would be an outpatient surgery and she would be home the same day.\nIn May 2011, Susan had a 6-level cervical spine fusion to stabilize her spine and relieve pressure on her spinal cord. When she woke up, she realized something was wrong. The entire right side of her body was paralyzed. What was supposed to be an outpatient surgery with a return home the same day ended up being an 8-week hospital and rehabilitation stay to learn how to walk again.\nIn August 2012, a second surgery was performed with the goal of pain relief. However, she reported her pain was significantly worse afterwards. She would receive weekly injections for pain relief that she reports would only marginally decrease her pain for about one week. She was also taking high doses of medication for nerve pain relief which she also reports provided marginal benefit. She had areas of heightened sensitivity on her legs where a bed sheet or even a gentle breeze would cause intense pain. Exposure to hot water would feel cold, and cold water would feel hot. She was unable to walk more than one block and remained in bed for over ten hours per day. She suffered extensive personal and professional quality of life losses at this time.\nLooking for relief, she tried medical yoga and received temporary relief. She also practiced traditional Tai Chi which provided minimal to no relief. She continued to have intense pain which had a significant impact on her quality of life and ability to perform daily tasks, including walking. In 2014, she tried a Qigong class and reported feeling that there was something very different about this class. Almost immediately, she felt a strong sense of relaxation that she had reportedly not found in many years. She was unable to attend many classes, so she purchased a video of the movements. Over the next year, she began to practice the exercises consistently until she could attend formal classes.\nSusan credits the practice of qigong with saving her life. She says it gave her a reason to get out of bed and socialize in the very early days of her practice. She is now able to walk with no limitations and her pain has improved by approximately 90%. Within three months of beginning qigong, she was able to stop all medications and injections she was receiving for pain relief. She continues to have some weakness in her arms and her hands, but it does not interfere with her ability to complete her daily activities. Despite her extensive cervical spine surgery, she reports full mobility in her shoulders and has nearly recovered full mobility in her neck. Her energy has also greatly improved and she routinely teaches three Qigong classes per week. In addition to this, she teaches at special events, including a Qigong class at a large yoga festival with over 1000 people in attendance. Recently, she started her first full time job in over six years.\nJames is a 70-year-old male. Over ten years ago, he was diagnosed with multi-level degenerative disc disease (DDD) in his lumbar spine, as well as severe central stenosis or narrowing of his spinal column around his spinal cord at L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1. In 2011, he had a CT scan and was told by his physician that it would not be long until he must rely on a wheelchair for all mobility. Surgery was presented as an option, but he was informed that the success rate was less than 10%.\nHe decided to forgo surgery and take his chances. Gradually, his legs became weaker and he would fall spontaneously. He worked as a salesman and as he was talking to clients, his legs would give out without warning and he would fall to the ground. To help his situation, he would park as close as he could to the entrance of stores or other destinations and would walk with carts or holding onto shelves or furniture. This would only help for so long before he would fall again.\nHe began looking for other options to help manage his condition. In 2012, he tried yoga. While it helped to temporarily control his pain, it had no effect on the weakness in his legs and he would continue to fall. One year later, at the suggestion of his wife, he tried a Qigong class. Due to his family’s personal schedules, he was unable to attend another class for two months. He decided to purchase a video of the movements he had learned and practiced them each day for 4–5 months until he was able to return to normal classes.\nSince participating in Qigong classes, he has not fallen even once, and has no reports of pain. He stated that “Qigong gave me my life back.” He has no other medical problems to mention and takes no medications. He revealed that the improvements he has experienced have gone far beyond what he expected. Where he used to fall often and without notice, he has not fallen since he began qigong and reports that he now even has a “spring to his step, and a spring in his heart.” Not too long ago, he sustained a left rotator cuff tear. After continuing to practice qigong, he had a full return of strength and movement with no pain or difficulty with his routine daily activities, all within six months.\nIn his professional life, he felt like he was burning out as an IT programmer but practicing qigong has reinvigorated him. He was able to complete many projects (some complex) that he never would have thought possible. He has since become certified to teach Qigong and tells anyone who will listen about his story. He has also witnessed many others gain significant benefit from the practice of Qigong and is thrilled that he gets to share this with others.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe neck pain and headache for years with aggravation and change in pain character'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastMedicalHistory': ['Heart attack 28 years ago', '40 pack-year history of cigarette smoking'], 'RecentTests': [{'Test': 'X-ray', 'Result': 'Multi-level degeneration of cervical spine'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Result': 'Cervical disc protrusion C4 to C7 and neuroforaminal stenosis with compression of the C6 nerve root'}]}}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Metastatic large cell undifferentiated carcinoma', 'Type': 'Cancer', 'Location': 'Lung, pancreas, adrenal glands'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Palliative radiochemotherapy', 'Details': ""Alleviated the patient's neck pain and headache""}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient discharged from hospital on request', 'DischargeStatus': 'Deceased in hospice 14 weeks later'}}}"
"A 78-year-old asymptomatic woman was referred to our hospital for further examination of multiple cardiac tumors in the left atrium and left ventricle, which had been detected on echocardiography conducted before chemotherapy for the third recurrence of breast cancer.\nThe patient was initially diagnosed with right breast cancer in 2003. She had undergone total mastectomy and lymph node dissection before adjuvant chemotherapy. Histopathological analysis indicated scirrhous carcinoma. The first recurrence of the breast cancer was diagnosed in 2007 due to right axillary adenopathy. She had again undergone operation before receiving chemoradiation, and hormonal therapy was started. The second recurrence was detected in 2013, when computed tomography (CT) was performed during a routine outpatient visit. The CT scan revealed right-sided pleural effusion and a mass shadow in the sternum. After switching to another hormonal medication, the pleural effusion disappeared. The third recurrence was confirmed by skin biopsy of a rash on the postoperative scar. Therefore, the regimen was changed to treat the third recurrence of breast cancer. Adriamycin was selected for the patient, and echocardiography was performed for cardiac screening. There were no signs or symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, platypnea, and systemic embolization until cardiac tumors were accidentally detected on echocardiography. She had never undergone echocardiography previously. She had no family history of cardiac myxoma. Physical examination and laboratory tests showed no spotty skin pigmentation or endocrine hyperfunction. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms showed 4 tumors in the left atrium and left ventricle ( and ). Coronary angiography showed feeding arteries from the left circumflex coronary artery to the tumors and no obstructive coronary lesion. Although we were not confident about the diagnosis, we decided on surgical resection because the mobile tumors located in the left semilunar cusp of the aortic valve and anterior mitral leaflet carried the risk of causing embolism or obstruction. On pathological examination, all 4 tumors were identified as myxomas (), since they showed myxoma cells with a stellate appearance proliferate in a myxoid background in nests and linear syncytia (). The patient's postoperative course was uneventful with no recurrences as determine by echocardiographic examination during the 12-month postoperative follow-up.","{

"A male patient, 62 years old, visited Good Samsun Hospital with a chief complaint of a right inguinal region mass accompanied by pain for the previous 3 months. He had no special history of disease; however, the year before his visit to our hospital, he had undergone hernia surgery due to an indolent fixed mass in the right inguinal region. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable, and a hard, fixed mass, accompanied by oppressive pain, with a size of 1 cm × 1 cm was felt in the right inguinal region. The patient's progress was observed for a month during which time an anti-inflammatory analgesic drug was administered to distinguish the oppressive pain from that which might have been generated by the previous hernia surgery. The biopsy of the spermatic cord showed a metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (). The image showed a thickening of the right spermatic cord, and infiltration around soft tissues was confirmed by using the scrotal sonography (). In addition, abdominal computed tomography indicated infiltration of the proximal sigmoid colon and rectum, as well as a diffuse peritoneal seeding metastasis (). A tumor accompanied by redness was observed in the rectum during the colonoscopy, and a core needle biopsy was conducted on that tumor. A mucinous adenocarcinoma that was identical to tissue previously taken from the spermatic cord was diagnosed based on the biopsy result (). Positron emission tomography (PET) () confirmed infiltration of the sigmoid colon, rectum, and cecum.\nThis patient received four rounds of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin with fluorouracil and folinic acid) anticancer chemotherapy, and the right spermatic cord mass was smaller on the abdominal computed tomography that that was done 10 weeks after the diagnosis of a spermatic cord tumor. However, the tumor sizes in the sigmoid colon and the rectum had not changed, and the possibility of a new seroperitoneum was checked. An exploratory laparotomy was conducted to confirm the possibility of salvage surgery to remove the primary lesion from the large intestine, but only an orchiectomy on the right side was completed because its metastasis in the peritoneum, omentum, and small bowel mesentery was extensive. Upon surgery, a broad metastasis in the peritoneum, omentum, and small bowel mesentery was confirmed (Peritoneal Cancer Index score, 22), and the biopsy of the peritoneum, omentum, and small bowel mesentery showed a metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma. As a result of this diagnosis, the therapy was changed to include palliative FOLFIRI (irinotecan with fluorouracil and folinic acid) chemotherapy. The patient came down with pneumonia after the 3rd FOLFIRI treatment. Antibiotic treatment was started, but the pneumonia proceeded to sepsis within a week. The patient finally passed away three months after the initial diagnosis.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain, redness, and swelling in the right thumb nail fold', 'Occasional pain in the radial aspect of the nail fold and interphalangeal joint', 'Nail deformity in the right thumb'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousConditions': 'Healthy female', 'PreviousInjury': 'No history of trauma', 'PreviousDiagnosis': 'Paronychia with positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and pyogenic granuloma'}, {'Test': 'Sentinel lymph node biopsy', 'Finding': 'Negative for malignancy'}, {'Test': 'HPV Testing', 'Finding': 'HPV type 18, 39, 45, 59, 68 detected'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Squamous cell carcinoma of the thumb', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Thumb nail fold and bone'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Nail bed, nail fold, and bone resection with local flap reconstruction', 'Details': 'Amputation at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Satisfactory', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing follow-up', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Pending further observations'}}}"
"A 75-year-old Caucasian man presented to the emergency room of our hospital for dyspnea and new onset generalized oedema rapidly progressing over one week. The patient was known for stable coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with oral anticoagulation, chronic obstructive bronchitis, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He had stopped smoking 3 years before, had no history of alcoholism, and had never taken illegal drugs.\nVital signs at presentation were stable. The patient was afebrile and not in respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed generalized oedema associated with ascites and hepatomegaly. The jugular veins were not distended, but there was a strong clinical suspicion of a right-sided pleural effusion. An initial chest X-ray confirmed an important right pleural effusion and a 1 cm sized nodule in the right lower lobe (not shown). Results of laboratory tests are shown in . Most strikingly, there was a new onset perturbation of liver markers.\nA contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and the pelvis was performed. The abdominal CT scan showed a very heterogeneous liver. Except for segments 2 and 3, the whole liver contained multiple ill-defined and partially confluent hypodensities of different size suggesting an advanced neoplastic process (). There was also a doubt of a hypodense lesion inside the inferior vena cava (). The hepatic lesions were associated with a moderate quantity of ascites but no splenomegaly (. The chest study confirmed the presence of a large right-sided pleural effusion and a 1 cm sized nodule in the anterior part of the right lower lung lobe (not shown). On transthoracic echocardiography, a well-defined, immobile oval mass with a smooth surface and a size of 23 mm × 30 mm was noted in the right atrium (). The mass was not adherent to the interatrial septum (). The mass extended to the inferior vena cava where it reached a size of 34 mm × 25 mm, creating a subtotal occlusion with a pressure gradient of 13 mmHg between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium (). The occluded inferior vena cava showed no respiratory compliance and had a diameter of 21 mm.\nA complete colonoscopy was negative for a neoplastic lesion, so liver biopsy under CT guidance was performed to establish a histological diagnosis. To complete the tumor staging and further characterize the endovascular lesion of the inferior vena cava and right atrium, a positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) was performed. On the PET imagery, there was a strong hypermetabolic zone in the right liver lobe covering an area of 13 cm × 14 cm × 13 cm (maximal normalized capture index 8.9) (). This hypermetabolic zone corresponded to the hepatic lesions seen on the CT scan and extended inside the inferior vena cava over a distance of 3.5 cm (). The hypermetabolic zone stopped at the junction of the inferior vena cava with the right atrium. No abnormal hypermetabolism was noted inside the heart (). The lung nodule seen on the CT scan was also hypermetabolic with a capture index of 2.3 suggesting a metastasis (not shown).\nThe histological examination of the liver biopsy demonstrated a hepatocellular carcinoma with a well- and a poorly-differentiated component (). There were no microscopical signs of liver cirrhosis on the specimen. The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein was 270 000 ng/mL. Taken together, these results established the final diagnosis of a stage IV locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with endovascular extension and a single pulmonary metastasis. It remains unclear if the metabolic inactive part of the endocaval and intra-atrial mass represented a superimposed thrombosis or necrotic tumor tissue.\nLaboratory tests to screen underlying risk factors of HCC were performed. Virus serology for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus was negative. The serum ferritin level was 398 μg/L, and the serum iron saturation was at 12%. The electrophoresis of serum proteins was normal eliminating alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.\nConfronted with the diagnosis, the patient did not desire further treatment and was orientated to palliative care.","{

"A 20-year-old Myanmarese woman who was aware of a declining vision in her left eye for three years was diagnosed with a mature cataract in her left eye. She was referred to Chiba University Hospital for further examination and treatment for the cataract. She had no medical history of the left eye, although detailed medical records were not available because she had grown up in Myanmar and had recently moved to Japan to receive occupational training. She did not have any systemic disease and abnormalities. The laboratory tests for infectious diseases were negative. She stated that she was born at full-term and had no family history of retinal detachment. Her left vision was light perception at our first examination. She had a mature cataract with a slightly shallow anterior chamber and the absence of inflammation and iris neovascularization. The dense cataract prevented a detailed examination of the fundus, but B-mode echogram showed some strands of high signals extending anteriorly from the optic nerve head (). Her right eye was normal with a vision of 20/20. The intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg OD and 18 mmHg OS. The axial length was 23.78 mm in the right eye and 23.46 mm in the left eye.\nShe underwent phacoemulsification and implantation of an intraocular lens in her left eye. The surgery was completed without any complications, and the postoperative course was uneventful with a recovery of the left vision to 20/200. A stalk was observed between the optic nerve and posterior capsule, but the retinal detachment was limited to the retina around the optic nerve. One and a half years after the initial surgery, she noticed a decline of the vision in her left eye, and her visual acuity was 20/400. The area of retinal detachment extended over two quadrants of the inferior retina (). There were no retinal breaks. A macula involved detachment was confirmed by optical coherence tomography. PPV with a 27-gauge system was performed, and the stalk was incised with a vitrectomy cutter. Some parts of the stalk were left attached to the optic nerve not to damage the anteriorly stretched retina. No additional procedures such as membrane peeling, drainage of subretinal fluid, and the fluid-air exchange were performed. The posterior vitreous was not separated because the hyaloid was degenerated and attached firmly to the retina. The retinal detachment gradually resolved, and the macula reattachment was confirmed by optical coherence tomography (). The vision in her left eye improved to 20/60 and was stable for 19 months after the second surgery without showing any worsening of the retinal proliferation or detachment.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Acute onset of epigastric pain and nausea with bilious emesis'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Computed Tomography', 'Finding': 'Soft tissue mass located posterior to the gallbladder'}, {'Test': 'Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography', 'Finding': 'Complex cystic structure at the porta hepatis'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Hemorrhagic benign ectopic liver tissue', 'Type': 'Benign mass', 'Location': 'Near gallbladder infundibulum'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical resection', 'Details': 'Excision of hemorrhagic mass attached to the gallbladder infundibulum and cholecystectomy performed'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on first postoperative day'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'One postoperative visit', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Asymptomatic'}}}"
"A 46-year-old asymptomatic man presented to our hospital for follow-up of an abnormal cardiac shadow found on chest X-ray during a medical check-up. He was found to have a benign tumor in the parapharyngeal space 6 years ago. The tumor had gradually grown in size and he felt pain around the back of his teeth and had difficulty in swallowing associated with mass pressing symptom; he had the tumor resected 4 months ago. On histopathology exam, the tumor was identified as a schwannoma. The patient had no medical or family history of cancer, including intradermal carcinomas. There were no abnormal findings in his eyegrounds, such as juvenile cataract, and his audiometry results were normal. Computed tomography (CT) showed three masses measuring 16 × 14 mm in the posterior mediastinum, 15 × 13 mm in the left pulmonary hilar area, and 12 × 10 mm in the right pulmonary apex area (Fig. ). The patient had undergone CT exam at another institute 6 years ago prior to the CT scan performed at our institute. Retrospective evaluation of the previous CT scan revealed that the posterior mediastinum tumor was 13 mm in size at that time. Chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that these masses had low intensity on T1-weighted sequences and high intensity on T2-weighted sequences. Cranial high-quality MRI showed no evidence of bilateral vestibular schwannoma. The thoracic surgeons at our institute initially diagnosed multiple mediastinal tumors.\nResection of the right apex area lesion had the associated risk of causing recurrent nerve deficit symptom; hence, removal of the two other tumors was planned initially; the posterior mediastinum tumor by right thoracotomy and the left pulmonary hilar area tumor by left thoracotomy in a single operation. During right thoracotomy, a small pericardial incision was made and they noticed the posterior mediastinal tumor to be at the cardiac chamber; surgery was suspended immediately. Following surgery, the patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which revealed that the mass was a cardiac tumor originating from the posterior wall of the left atrium (LA) without a stalk (Fig. ). Moreover, an atrial septal defect (ASD) was discovered, which seemed to be an ostium secundum defect with left to right shunt.\nFollowing discharge, the patient was immediately brought to our clinic. Although the patient was asymptomatic, we decided to resect the mass and obtain a confirmed histopathological diagnosis. Cardiac tumor resection was performed 5 months following the explorative thoracotomy. In a median sternotomy approach, the LA was incised through Waterston’s groove after a cardiopulmonary bypass. Even though the tumor was located under the endocardium, we resected it completely as it surrounded the LA wall. The defect in the LA posterior wall was 40 × 30 mm in size. In a right atriotomy, the ASD was identified as three small holes in the thin wall of the fossa ovalis; these were resected, resulting in a defect measuring 30 × 15 mm. The defects caused by excisions were repaired using bovine pericardium (Fig. ). The cut surface of the tumor was hard and yellowish in color. Pathology evaluation showed it had negative tissue margins. Spindle-shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei different in size showed a palisading arrangement, and immunohistochemical stain was positive for S-100 protein (Fig. ). These findings were consistent with benign schwannoma [, ].\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient is scheduled for regular follow-up. One year after the cardiac tumor resection, no findings suggestive of recurrence of cardiac tumor were noted and follow-up tests, such that TEE and CT showed no significant growth of the two remnant mediastinal tumors or residual shunt.","{

She was born with a normal birth weight but large head circumference for which she never had a diagnostic analysis. At the age of five, her body weight was already significantly higher compared to her peers. No specific life events could explain her obesity. Cognitive development was normal and she followed normal education. She underwent treatment for recurrent nasal polyps. Her mother also had a large head size and suffered from morbid obesity as well. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and died from a pulmonary embolism after placement of an Adjustable Gastric Band. A maternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 and the maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at young age. The younger sister of the index patient was overweight and was reported to also have a large head size (Figure ).\nSince childhood, the index patient followed several different coaching programs to change her eating behavior and exercise pattern to induce weight loss. She lost weight several times but was never able to maintain her weight loss. At the time of the intake procedure at the bariatric clinic, her height was 1.69 m (SD −0.2) and weight 164 kg (SD +6.8), resulting in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 57.6 kg/m2 and a predominant abdominal obesity. Head size was not measured at that time since this is not part of bariatric screening procedures. Biochemical analysis of the blood revealed no abnormalities, and excluded endocrine hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism. The fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM.\nThe combination of early onset morbid obesity resulted in suspicion of a genetic cause of her obesity. She was offered diagnostic genetic analysis of 52 obesity–associated genes to identify a possible underlying genetic obesity cause.\nThe patient was eligible for bariatric surgery and underwent a sleeve gastrectomy without complications (performed in 2014 using a standardized fashion). At 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery, she achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss of 39.4, 48.8 and 44.9, respectively. This resulted in a current BMI of 30.1 kg/m2. This was within the range of the results which were observed in a control group of 18 female patients, with a negative obesity genetic test result. These female patients were matched for age and BMI and achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss (TBWL) of 30.3 after 1 year, 31 after 2 years and 30 after 3 years of follow-up.\nA few months after surgery, the result of the obesity gene panel analysis was returned and showed heterozygosity for a known pathogenic mutation in the PTEN gene (): c.202T>C p.(Tyr68His). This mutation has been described previously in patients with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PTEN HTS) (Marsh et al., ). No other pathogenic mutations were shown in the remaining 50 obesity–associated genes (Table ). At the genetic clinic, a head circumference of 63 cm (+5SD) and pedigree analysis (family history of multiple tumors) further supported the molecular diagnosis of PTEN HTS.\nAccording to the PTEN HTS guidelines, patients with pathogenic PTEN mutations are advised to visit the outpatient clinic for familial tumors, for lifelong surveillance of tumors that are associated with the PTEN mutations (Dutch Guidelines, ; Eng, ). Our patient underwent additional biochemical laboratory- and ultrasound screening to exclude thyroid gland carcinoma. Besides a few benign nodules on the ultrasound, no abnormalities could be determined. A yearly follow-up ultrasound of her thyroid gland and yearly serum thyroid stimulating hormone analysis was advised. Screening for breast, endometrium and colorectal cancer, also revealed no anomalies.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Recurrent left lower extremity swelling'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousHistory': 'Deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Venous Doppler Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending towards the left common iliac vein, compression of left iliac vein by the right iliac artery, elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein suggestive of May-Thurner syndrome (MTS)'}, {'Test': 'Intravenous Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Common iliac vein narrowed significantly to less than 2 mm and normalization prior to entering the inferior vena cava, stent migration noted'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'May-Thurner syndrome (MTS)', 'Type': 'Vascular condition', 'Location': 'Left lower extremity and iliac veins'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Endovascular stenting and thrombolysis', 'Details': 'Deployment of Luminexx and Wallstent stents, catheter-directed thrombolysis for recurrent DVT, IVC filter placement, mechanical thrombectomy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complicated by stent migration, atrial fibrillation, pericardial tamponade, massive PE, thoracic hematoma', 'DischargeStatus': 'Started on rivaroxaban indefinitely'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '5-year follow-up', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Residual postthrombotic syndrome managed with compression stockings'}}}"
"A 63-year-old Caucasian male with two weeks of lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and two episodes of loss of consciousness presented to an outside emergency room due to an abrupt onset of unilateral paresis of the right side of the body as well as speech deficits. The patient was evaluated for stroke and deferred administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to the length of time between onset of symptoms and presentation to the emergency department. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck was ordered and demonstrated occlusion of the intradural right vertebral artery with a severe stenosis of the intradural left vertebral artery. There was a partially occlusive thrombus extending out of the occluded right vertebral artery into the proximal basilar artery (Figure ). It was decided that the patient be transported to our high volume certified Comprehensive Stroke Center where he could receive more specialized treatment. Before transport, he regained full strength and speech which seemed to be largely dependent on blood pressure.\nUpon arrival to our facility, his only complaint was paresthesia of the right foot and blurred vision as well as exacerbation of symptomology with changes in body position. A cerebral digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) revealed that the intracranial segment of the right vertebral artery was recently occluded and likely related to an underlying severe atherosclerotic stenosis near the dural ring. There was also a markedly severe stenosis of the contralateral intradural left vertebral artery (Figure ). DSA also demonstrated the presence of an unstable, partially occlusive clot at the vertebrobasilar junction and a congenital corkscrew configuration of the mid-basilar artery distal to the clot. Due to the precarious nature of the clot in both stability and location as well as the aberrant configuration of the basilar artery prohibiting thrombectomy options, the decision was made to provide dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin for several days in an effort to resolve the unstable clot and allow for development of more favorable conditions in which stenting of the left vertebral artery lesion could occur. Care was taken to maintain the patient at a slightly elevated blood pressure in order to maintain flow through the collateral circulation and not exacerbate any further ischemic damage.\nThe care team developed an emergency plan for potential neurological decompensation requiring emergent transport to the interventional neuroradiology suite. Fortunately, the patient remained stable and without additional neurological deficits. Approximately five days after transfer to our facility, the patient underwent repeat CTA which revealed resolution of unstable thrombus at the vertebrobasilar junction (Figure ). The distal intradural right vertebral artery remained occluded. The following day, the patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology department and placed under general anesthesia with careful attention given to adequate blood pressure during induction. DSA confirmed the absence of unstable clot in the proximal basilar artery and redemonstrated the severe left vertebral artery stenosis (Figure ). Placement of a balloon-mounted coronary stent across the severe stenosis eliminated any narrowing of the left vertebral artery (Figure ). There was a return of normal posterior fossa flow dynamics, and the patient made a full clinical recovery.","{

"A 60-year-old male presented to the emergency department with urinary retention. After a catheter was placed in the patient's bladder gross hematuria was observed. The patient's medical history is significant for a dual pancreas and kidney transplant 16 years before this emergency department presentation. He received these transplants due to end-stage renal disease caused by type 1 diabetes mellitus. His graft function has been stable since transplant and he no longer requires insulin. He does, however, have retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy complications associated with his Type 1 diabetes diagnosis. The patient has had a colonoscopy for unintended weight loss performed a year before this emergency department visit that revealed no visual abnormalities. Upon physical examination, his vital signs were found to be stable and there were no signs of infection. He did have suprapubic tenderness.\nThe serum creatinine was 114 μmol/L with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60 when this patient presented to the emergency department. No abnormalities were noted in the rest of the patient's blood work. The patient proceeded to undergo flexible cystoscopy to identify the source of the hematuria. A lesion that was highly suspicious for urothelial carcinoma was identified at the ureteral orifice (). It did appear that the lesion was coming from either the transplant ureter or transplant junction. The rest of the procedure was unremarkable apart from a false passage in the urethra likely from a past catheter insertion. A follow-up CT scan showed no hydronephrosis or urothelial thickening in the transplanted kidney. No mass lesion in the bladder could be identified, however, there was some mild thickening in the dome of the bladder, which was suspected to be inflammatory changes due to pancreatic duct dilatation.\nGiven the findings on cystoscopy, a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was recommended for the patient. The patient was counseled regarding treatment options and informed consent was obtained for the procedure. The patient's antirejection medications were modified in anticipation of the upcoming surgery. After the patient had received appropriate antibiotics and a general anesthetic, a 26F resectoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra. The tumor was identified after entering the bladder. It had a relatively small stalk adjacent to bowel mucosa that was protruding into the bladder from the graft. The tumor was resected and sent to pathology for analysis. In addition, multiple cold-cup biopsies were taken from the resection site and around the bladder. The conduit was gently inspected to ensure that no perforation had occurred during the procedure. A 20F two-way Foley catheter was placed at the end of the procedure, and the patient was sent to recovery in good condition.\nAnalysis of the pathological specimens following the procedure revealed that the resected lesion at the conduit site was not a urothelial carcinoma, but instead a tubulovillous adenoma (). This tumor is typical for an enteric-type adenoma likely arising from the duodenal graft from the donor instead of the bladder. There was no indication of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma in the polyps. The rest of the biopsies of the bladder did not reveal any malignant changes. Following the procedure, the patient's renal function remained stable with a creatinine of 105 μmol/L and an estimated GFR of 67 mL/minute.\nThe patient was followed up with cystoscopy 3 months after the operation to reevaluate the site for any signs of recurrence. At this time a small tumor was noted near the previous site of resection but farther up the conduit (). It is unknown whether this represents a new tumor or a recurrence of the previously resected tumor. The pathology for this resection revealed a tubular adenoma. Imaging with a CT scan and a chest X-ray did not reveal any disease outside of the conduit and bladder. A 7 mm tumor was noted in the conduit in keeping with the cystoscopy imaging.\nAfter considering these findings and discussing them with the patient as well as a transplant surgeon colleague, it was determined that the recommended treatment was a laparotomy and excision of this tumor in an open manner. An incision was made inferior to the urachus with cautery down through the fascia. The space of Retzius was developed and a catheter was placed in the surgical field allowing for the insufflation of the bladder. A cystoscope was then introduced allowing the visualization of the dome of the bladder. The bladder was then spatulated with care being given to preserve the pancreas conduit and the transplant ureter. The conduit junction was identified and inverted bluntly to allow direct visualization of the tumor. The tumor was then excised and the excision site was oversewn. Direct visualization did not reveal any other tumor tissue within the conduit. A frozen section of the tumor base revealed negative surgical margins during the surgery. These frozen pathology sections revealed a tubulovillous adenoma with low grade dysplasia. The incisions made were closed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition with minimal blood loss. His postoperative stay in hospital was uneventful apart from some nausea and vomiting. The patient's most recent follow-up cystoscopy, however, shows no signs of regrowth (). No further biopsies were taken on this cystoscopy.\nThe patient is to be followed with serial cystoscopies every 6 months for the next 3 years to reevaluate the site for any signs of recurrence. If recurrence should occur, further surgical management options will be decided upon at that time. It is not believed that the rest of this patient's gastrointestinal tract is at significantly increased risk of tumor formation due to this finding as this tumor arose either donor and/or bladder tissue. Follow-up will be continued with the patient's transplant surgeon and nephrologist at his regularly scheduled appointments at the transplant clinic.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Decreased fetal movements', 'Presence of fetal malformation with postural deformity of lower limbs'], 'MedicalHistory': {'ObstetricHistory': {'CurrentPregnancy': '16th week of gestation', 'PreviousMyomas': 'Two intramural uterine myomas smaller than 47 mm in diameter'}}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Findings': {'UterineFibroids': [{'Type': 'Intramural-submucosal', 'Location': 'Anterior uterine wall near internal cervical os', 'Size': '110x88 mm'}, {'Type': 'Intramural', 'Location': 'Uterine fundus', 'Size': '28x21 mm'}], 'FetalCondition': {'HeartRate': 'Normal', 'Movements': 'Absent, displaced to right uterine wall', 'Position': 'Abnormal with hyperextension of head and flexed lower limbs'}}}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Arthrogryposis secondary to fetal akinesia', 'Cause': 'Giant leiomyoma', 'Location': 'Uterus'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Elective termination of pregnancy', 'DeliveryMethod': 'Vaginal induction with local prostaglandins'}, 'PostoperativeCourse': {'Complications': 'None', 'FetalOutcome': {'Weight': '105 g', 'Length': '125 mm', 'ExternalGenitals': 'Male', 'Deformities': 'Severe equinovarus deformities of the feet'}, 'PathologyFindings': 'Internal organs normal, extraconnective tissue around joints, tissue between muscle fibers swollen'}}}"
"A 48-year-old male presented with his RUQ abdominal pain that is relieved by lying on the right side and sleeping. The patient had no past history of any disease, nor diagnosed of any chronic illnesses. The computed tomography (CT) scan for abdomen was done and showed large retroperitoneal mass of heterogeneous density, with heterogeneous contrast enhancement posterior to the liver (Fig. ). The mass measured 11 × 11 × 12 cm displacing the right kidney, and the right lobe of the liver and IVC anteriorly. There was focal invasion of the liver measuring 3.6 × 6.4 cm at Segment 7. The right adrenal gland was not clearly visible. The patient underwent an US-guided core biopsy of the mass that showed malignant cells consistent with both adrenocortical carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, the former diagnosis was favored based on the clinical picture. The patient went for a right hepatectomy with right adrenalectomy, cholecystectomy and excision of associated lymph nodes. The lesion and the excised structures were sent for histopathology that showed a right liver lobe mass attached to it measuring 17 × 10 × 7 cm, and the cut section of the mass showed nodular surface with multiple areas of necrosis. Slicing of the liver showed a gray white mass measuring 5 × 5 × 3 cm, which is adherent to the mass and the remaining liver parenchyma appear unremarkable. The microscopic examination of the mass revealed a moderately differentiated HCC measuring 5 cm in diameter, confined to the liver, <5 cm from resection margins and no lymph-vascular invasion (Fig. ), and a separate adrenocortical neoplasm measuring 17 cm in diameter, multiple foci of necrosis, no capsular or lymph-vascular invasion and resection margins were not involved by the tumor (Fig. ). Excised lymph nodes included a single right portal vein lymph node, a gallbladder lymph node and seven para aortic lymph nodes. All lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. Gallbladder examination showed no significant pathology. Postoperative assessment of the patient revealed that he recovered gradually and was discharged.","{

"The patient is a 46-year-old female with SCC of the breast. She initially had silicone gel breast implantation for breast augmentation in 1995. The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data. She followed up in clinic in June 2016 without complications or clinical recurrence.\nFollow-up CT scan performed in August 2016 displayed a right upper lobe lung nodule and findings were suspicious for local recurrence (Figure ). She underwent right video thoracoscopy and right upper lobe wedge resection. The pathology was consistent with metastatic moderately differentiated SCC. The patient declined chemotherapy at this time. CT chest and abdomen at another hospital showed new cavitary lung nodules and right renal and psoas abscess. In February 2017, retroperitoneal fine needle aspiration of the right renal collection was positive for SCC. In June 2017, she was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and was found to have progressive disease. CT abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast on 6/16/17 demonstrated a 6.1 cm x 5.7 cm heterogeneous lesion in the right kidney lower pole with invasion into the adjacent right psoas muscle (Figure ). Progressive metastases to the liver, lungs and retroperitoneum were noted as well. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and core biopsy of the liver was positive for metastatic SCC with keratinization and necrosis.\nHer hospital course was complicated by non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, recurrent anemia requiring transfusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and hypotension. She was noted to have leptomeningeal spread. She was ultimately transferred from the medical intensive care unit to the palliative care unit for comfort care. She expired of her disease in July 2017, one year after her initial diagnosis of cancer.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Weakness in all four limbs and bladder involvement for the past 18 months', 'Mild neck pain aggravated by activity'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Fall in the bathroom leading to degenerative cervical spondylotic myelopathy with OPLL and central cord syndrome'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Radiograph of the cervical spine', 'Finding': 'Loosening and back out of upper screws of the anterior cervical plate'}, {'Test': 'CT chest', 'Finding': 'Screw in the abdomen'}, {'Test': 'Colonoscopy', 'Finding': 'Erosion of superficial mucosa without perforation of the colon due to screw'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Degenerative cervical spondylotic myelopathy with OPLL and central cord syndrome', 'Type': 'Degenerative spinal condition', 'Location': 'Cervical spine'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Anterior C5 cervical corpectomy with mesh cage, bone grafting, and anterior cervical plating', 'Details': 'Followed by removal of loose screws, plate, and additional posterior stabilization'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Patient is self-voiding, independent walker, and able to perform most activities of daily living', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1.5 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved JOA score from 8/17 to 13/17 at final follow-up'}}}"

"A 53-year-old healthy female with known hypothyroidism being treated with thyroid hormone replacement presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain and palpitations. Her electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a continuous murmur at the left sternal border. She spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm with complete resolution of her chest pain. Her troponin I level was 17 ng/ml. EKG-gated multidetector cardiac computed tomographic angiography revealed the presence of a large anomalous left main coronary arising from the main pulmonary artery (). The left anterior descending artery, diagonal branch, and left circumflex arteries arising from the left main were ectatic vessels with extensive collateralization with a large ectatic right coronary artery arising from the right aortic coronary sinus (). She remained asymptomatic, and her troponins normalized. Her atrial fibrillation was attributed to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism resulting from an excess in recommended doses for thyroid replacement therapy. The thyroid stimulating hormone level was noted to be low and reported at 0.05 mU/L.\nA 2D echocardiogram revealed normal biventricular size and function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Ventricular wall thickness was calculated to be normal in addition to normal left ventricular diastolic function and filling pressures. There were no advanced valvular abnormalities, and a mild degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation was present. There was evidence of markedly increased color Doppler signaling within the interventricular septum suggestive of high blood flow through septal collaterals (Figures and ). Coronary angiography showed evidence of retrograde blood flow in the left coronary system into the pulmonary trunk through collateral supply from the systemic side, secondary to relatively low right-sided pressures, and vascular resistance causing coronary steal (). Our patient was offered surgery for reimplantation of her left main into the aorta but she refused. Considering that her presentation of myocardial damage was secondary to a lack of oxygenated blood during increased demand at the time of tachycardia, a rhythm control strategy for the atrial fibrillation was adopted and the patient was discharged from the hospital on a reduced dose of thyroid replacement therapy with close follow-up.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Presence of a round metallic foreign body in the upper esophagus', 'Vague upper respiratory symptoms with food regurgitation and frequent vomiting over the past seven months'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'None'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest radiograph', 'Finding': 'Round metallic density over the upper esophagus with mass effect on the trachea'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Round metallic object at the level of the upper esophagus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Foreign body ingestion (button battery)', 'Type': 'Mechanical obstruction', 'Location': 'Upper esophagus'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Right posterolateral thoracotomy with esophagostomy and esophagoplasty', 'Details': 'Successful removal of button battery with extrapleural approach'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Smooth and uncomplicated', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Two days', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved respiratory and eating symptoms post-removal'}}}"
"A 25-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic with a complaint of recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek of three-month duration. He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region. We suspected the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. A periapical view was then taken with gutta-percha inserted into the sinus for foreign body localization purpose. The radiograph revealed the gutta-percha pointed towards the site of titanium plate and screws placed used for rigid fixation, and with the molar orthodontic tube appliance in its vicinity (). A cone beam CT was performed to provide a 3D detailed location of the appliance (Figures and ) and confirmed it to be located outside the maxillary antrum.\nThe presence of the molar orthodontic tube foreign body reaction was suspected as the most probable cause of the recurrent right cheek pain and swelling associated with an intraoral discharging sinus. Exploration of the site was performed through the sulcular incision under general anesthesia. The dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap. It was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. Just below it, one titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was inspected and found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone. However, a decision was made to remove them based on the fact that they are present in an infected area. (). The Le Fort I osteotomy site showed good healing with new bone formation. Patient had an uneventful recovery thereafter, and the orthognathic surgical team who attended him previously was informed of his progress.","{

"The patient is a 46-year-old female with SCC of the breast. She initially had silicone gel breast implantation for breast augmentation in 1995. The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data. She followed up in clinic in June 2016 without complications or clinical recurrence.\nFollow-up CT scan performed in August 2016 displayed a right upper lobe lung nodule and findings were suspicious for local recurrence (Figure ). She underwent right video thoracoscopy and right upper lobe wedge resection. The pathology was consistent with metastatic moderately differentiated SCC. The patient declined chemotherapy at this time. CT chest and abdomen at another hospital showed new cavitary lung nodules and right renal and psoas abscess. In February 2017, retroperitoneal fine needle aspiration of the right renal collection was positive for SCC. In June 2017, she was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and was found to have progressive disease. CT abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast on 6/16/17 demonstrated a 6.1 cm x 5.7 cm heterogeneous lesion in the right kidney lower pole with invasion into the adjacent right psoas muscle (Figure ). Progressive metastases to the liver, lungs and retroperitoneum were noted as well. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and core biopsy of the liver was positive for metastatic SCC with keratinization and necrosis.\nHer hospital course was complicated by non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, recurrent anemia requiring transfusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and hypotension. She was noted to have leptomeningeal spread. She was ultimately transferred from the medical intensive care unit to the palliative care unit for comfort care. She expired of her disease in July 2017, one year after her initial diagnosis of cancer.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Painful deformities of the right hip and knee', 'Type I open wound right leg'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Road traffic accident with ipsilateral hip and knee injuries'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT brain', 'Finding': 'Acute hemorrhagic contusion'}, {'Test': 'Radiographs', 'Finding': 'Posterior dislocation of right hip and knee with comminuted fracture right distal tibia'}, {'Test': 'MRI right knee', 'Finding': 'PCL avulsion fracture and lateral collateral ligament avulsion fracture'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Multi-ligament instability', 'Type': 'Orthopedic', 'Location': 'Right hip, knee'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Closed reduction, ankle spanning exfix, locking compression plate fixation, arthroscopic PCL reconstruction, open posterolateral corner repair', 'Details': 'Multiple procedures to address various fractures and ligament tears'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Good recovery of common peroneal nerve, stable hip and knee, viable femoral head'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Full range of movements at right hip and knee, returned to preinjury level of activity'}}}"
"Patient No. 4 was a 69 year old male with a history of laryngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy several years prior to presentation. He required a tracheostomy at the time of his cancer diagnosis but was subsequently decannulated after therapy. His past medical was significant for coronary artery disease requiring stenting, hypertension and uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. He developed right angle torsion and subluxation of trachea at the site of his tracheostomy site that was not amenable to endoscopic resection. He underwent cervicothoracic tracheal resection involving the cricoid and 3 tracheal rings, with primary anastomosis. On POD#3 he developed an anastomotic leak. He was taken to the operating room with the intent to place a tracheostomy through the dehiscent trachea but the anastomosis was noted to abut the innominate artery. Therefore, the tracheal dehiscence was primarily repaired and covered with sternohyoid muscle advancement and he was left intubated with the cuff past the anastomosis. A repeat bronchoscopy on POD#6 revealed intact anastomotic site but he failed extubation trial due to development of supraglottic edema from prolonged intubation and inability to clear secretions and a tracheostomy was performed. The tracheostomy incision was made vertically and encompassed the airway anastomotic site and a stomaplasty was performed to protect the innominate artery and to support the tracheal anastomosis. He subsequently underwent one endoscopic treatment 4 months after airway resection and was decannulated successfully. The patient continues to do well with mild grade 1 stenosis 5.5 years later.\nThere were two patients who could not be decannulated (). Patient 5 had somewhat poorly controlled COPD and a history of tracheal stenting, a procedure that predisposes patients to re-stenosis at the level of the stent []. He was noted to aspirate after resection. Therefore, a tracheostomy was placed for pulmonary toilet, and the anastomosis eventually restenosed completely. He prioritized eating over speaking and no further intervention was performed. Patient 7 was a 72 years old male who developed airway stenosis after an emergent slash tracheostomy using a vertical incision. Advanced age is identified by several studies as a risk factor for poor surgical outcome after tracheal resection. At the time of resection, the condition of the tracheal wall was very poor and the cricoid plus 6 tracheal rings were resected. Postoperatively, he developed an infection resulting in anastomotic dehiscence. He was taken back to the operating room for debridement of the necrotic anterior tracheal wall and for tracheostomy placement. The tracheostomy was eventually replaced with a T-tube. After 5 years with the T-tube the patient was lost to follow up.","{

"Case 1: a 54-year-old male patient was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath simultaneous abdominal pain, stiffness, and swelling. The patient was referred to specialist pulmonologist. Thorax CT scan revealed the presence of common pleural effusion on the right side of the patient and changes in the lung fields adjacent to the effusion revealed the presence of passive atelectasis. The presence of collapse and consolidation was revealed in the right lateral segment lung. Thoracic surgery consultation was requested for the patient because of the right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed to the patient by the thoracic surgeon. Cytological examination of the material was reported to be compatible with malignant epithelial tumor. However, distinction of mesothelioma and carcinomatous adenocarcinoma could not be made as a result of cytopathology. He had no known previous exposure to asbestos. In abdominal examination, an abdominal mass was palpated in the right upper quadrant. Abdominal CT was also performed to the patient because of prolonged abdominal pain. In abdominal CT imaging, suspected invasion of omentum has been found in hepatic flexure and right transvers colon (). In addition, suspected infiltration and signs of compression of these colonic segments were determined. Laparotomy was scheduled for the intraabdominal mass. Mass of the omentum adherent to the hepatic flexure was found in the operation. After dissection of adhesions, the patient underwent total omentectomy. There was no other pathology in the abdomen. After recovery, the patient was discharged. Histopathology revealed malignant mesothelioma (). Patient was referred to medical oncology after the period of recovery. Chemotherapy was administered to the patient by the medical oncology specialist. Control abdominal CT was performed after six cycles of chemotherapy. Two cystic lesions were detected in CT. One of them was in size of 18 × 12 cm and located inferior of the right lobe of the liver and the other one was in size of 10 × 8 cm and located in right inferior quadrant. Percutaneous drainage was performed for both cysts. The patient was hospitalized until the cysts completely collapsed. The patient was discharged after recovery. Patient is in follow-up period.\nIn the second case, a 40-year-old male patient was admitted with abdominal pain that has continued for 2 months and abdominal swelling in the right upper quadrant. There was a palpable mass in the right hypochondrium in the physical examination. In the size of 7 × 5 cm, mass originating from the gallbladder was detected in the abdominal CT (). The decision of the operation was given for the patient. The gallbladder was greater than normal size and in size of 7 × 5 cm, and tumoral mass was found originating from the inferior wall of the gallbladder. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy and resection of liver segment adjacent to gallbladder. The histopathology revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma (). The patient was discharged and referred to medical oncology after the recovery.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Difficulty in opening the mouth for the past 2 years', 'History of pain and swelling in the left thigh region and limited movement of the left leg'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Trauma with wooden thorn on the left cheek region, surgical removal of thorn, progressive reduced mouth opening', 'PreviousMedicalCondition': 'History of pain and swelling in the left thigh region, limited movement of the left leg, misdiagnosed and operated for bony growth in the left thigh in 2016 resulting in total immobility of the left leg, cord-like ossification of muscles and soft tissue, microdactyly of the great toe on both feet'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'CT-scan', 'Finding': 'Radiodense mass extending in front of the anterior border of the ramus of the mandible, suggestive of ossified masseter muscle'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Large elongated T1–T2 intermediate signal intensity lesion with mild surrounding edema in the substance of left masseter muscle, abutting the ramus of left mandible likely to represent heterotopic bone formation'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP)', 'Type': 'Connective tissue disorder', 'Location': 'Maxillofacial region, left thigh, left leg'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Observation and precautionary measures', 'Details': 'Keeping the patient under observation due to the risk of further deterioration from surgical intervention'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Limited mobility in the left leg, progressive ossification observed'}}}"
"An 80-year-old woman with a history of collapse at home was admitted to Emergency when she had a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated and intubated. She also had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She had a past history of total thyroidectomy.\nWhile she was ventilated in the ICU she developed pneumonia, was treated and extubated. She had another episode of respiratory distress and needed re-intubation, was ventilated and shifted to our hospital.\nOn admission she had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding which was treated endoscopically. She got infected with acinotobacter in the sputum, had bilateral pleural effusion and was unweanable from the ventilator. Considering the status of the patient a decision was taken to do the PDT electively. This was expected to facilitate the weaning from the ventilator or as a therapeutic measure considering the uncertainty of duration of the ventilator support.\nHer past history of thyroidectomy was considered in expecting an altered anatomy and difficulty in identifying the landmarks during PDT. The patient was positioned for PDT and prepared and draped. On identification of landmarks with palpation, a pulse was felt which is unusual at the midline of the trachea at the level of the third and fourth tracheal rings. The pulse was rhythmic with the monitor which confirmed the presence of an artery. The artery was traced superiorly and inferiorly and it was seen that it became lateral to the trachea on the right side.\nThe confirmation of this distortion was done by ultrasound guidance (sonosite M turbo - USA) with a high-frequency linear probe. The sonoanotomy revealed that the right common carotid artery after emerging in the neck ascended in the neck very close to the trachea and formed a loop anterior to the trachea at the level of the third and fourth rings and ascended laterally further before dividing into the external and internal carotid arteries []. There were no other abnormalities seen in the vasculature either on the right side or left side. The procedure was abandoned citing the abnormal anatomy and expected difficulties in the PDT. The case was referred to thoracic surgery for surgical tracheostomy and the findings on ultrasound were confirmed during surgical tracheostomy []. There was presence of fibrous tissue lateral to the trachea on both sides, on the right the common carotid artery was found adherent to the tracheal wall and forming a loop anterior to the trachea. The surgical tracheostomy was done successfully.","{

"A 21-year-old male was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and sustained multiple injuries, including a right closed subtrochanteric femur fracture, bilateral pulmonary contusions, as well as a splenic injury requiring an exploratory laparotomy with splenectomy upon arrival to the hospital. Due to hemodynamic instability, a distal femoral traction pin with 25 pounds of weight was placed in his right femur on the date of admission as a temporary stabilization of his fracture. This smooth traction pin was placed without difficulty using sterile technique and was placed from medial to lateral at the level of the adductor tubercle. The pin sites were then covered with a sterile dressing. Radiographs of his fracture are shown in .\nThe patient's overall condition worsened over the ensuing three days, with development of high fevers, increasing leukocytosis, and continued cardiopulmonary lability. He remained intubated throughout his hospitalization. Due to significantly increased swelling and erythema about the right thigh and hip region, a plain radiograph as well as computed tomography scan was ordered to evaluate for abscess or hematoma formation. Representative images from the scan are shown in . Mild serous drainage was seen about the traction pin sites, but no purulence was noted. The edema and erythema in the region of the knee was significant as well and was slightly more than the proximal thigh.\nDue to the findings of a significant amount of soft tissue gas in his thigh extending to the groin and caudal abdominal wall, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for evaluation and debridement. Upon incision into the thigh, malodorous gas was released, and it was discovered that all of the distal muscle and fascia were necrotic; due to these findings, the decision was made to undergo a proximal open guillotine transfemoral amputation through his fracture site. He also underwent debridement of his lower abdominal wall at this time, with removal of all necrotic tissues. Intraoperative deep tissue specimens were obtained at this time and identified Clostridium perfringens as the culprit. Unfortunately, the infection continued to spread, and he underwent a hip disarticulation with further abdominal and groin debridement the following day. A final debridement of his hip musculature, including removal of his ipsilateral testicle, was performed two days after his initial amputation. Unfortunately, due to further development of intra-abdominal infection in the face of continued cardiopulmonary instability, the decision was made by family to withdraw support; he ultimately passed away eight days after his injury.","{

"A 49-year old female patient was admitted to the department of neurosurgery at another hospital under the diagnosis of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. She underwent a decompressive craniectomy, surgical neck clipping of ruptured aneurysm and hematoma removal. The patient was treated in the intensive care unit for three weeks. The patient had no prior operative history of tracheostomy, and a cranioplasty was performed. Following the completion of intensive care, the patient was moved to a general ward, and transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine. At the time of the transfer, the patient was alert and conscious with motor power in the right upper and lower extremities that presented at a grade one on examination. To independently turn-over in bed was possible, but sitting-up required moderate assistance. The patient showed difficulty in maintaining balance while seated and generally required moderate assistance in daily activities. The patient was on Levin tube feeding, and treatment for dysphagia was carried out. The patient was transferred to our department of rehabilitation medicine at ten weeks after the onset of a hemorrhagic stroke. On admission to our hospital, the patient presented with persistent dysphagia, and was still receiving Levin tube feeding. Cervical pain with severity of grade four to five according to visual analogue scale was rated by the patient. The exact onset of diabetes mellitus was uncertain but HbA1c was 5.5% on laboratory examination, and the patient had no family history of diabetes mellitus. The patient was on insulin therapy, but the medication regimen was modified to the administration of Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg two times a day owing to adequate control of blood glucose level, and afterward, the patient had a favorable blood glucose level. The vital signs were stable on admission with a blood pressure at 106/73 mmHg, heart rate 98/minute, respiratory rate 19/minute and body temperature of 36.3℃, and the patient did not present with respiratory distress. Motor power examination showed normal findings on the left side, but the right upper extremity presented with a grade one and the right lower extremity presented with grade two. Her cognitive function was rated with score of 22 according to Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Blood test results showed no remarkable abnormal findings other than a mildly elevated ESR level of ESR 36 mm/hr. Other results revealed WBC 8,410/µl and CRP 0.04 mg/dl. On a video fluoroscopy swallowing test for the evaluation of dysphagia, retropharyngeal edema was identified, which lead to impairment of a migration of bolus into the esophagus, and the aspiration occurred due to residual contents (). With a consultation to the department of otolaryngology, a laryngoscopy was performed and retropharyngeal edema and profuse discharge were identified (). A cervical computed tomography examination showed generalized retropharyngeal edema and cortical contrast enhancement of the fourth cervical spine along with partial osteoclastic findings (). An additional differential diagnosis of retropharyngeal abscess, malignant tumor and tuberculous spondylitis, cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out, and revealed a signal change at the medulla from the second to the fourth cervical spine along with generalized retropharyngeal edema. At the anterior portion of the second to fourth cervical spine, a soft tissue lesion of low signal intensity on T1, high signal intensity on T2, and contrast enhancement was identified (). The marginal portion of the abscess did not show contrast enhancement, and the posterior portion of the vertebral body adjacent to the retropharyngeal space showed contrast enhancement. This lead to difficulty in excluding the malignant tumor, and a biopsy was planned. The location of the lesion was difficult to access for complete resection or incision and drainage. Since the trial of the incision and drainage does not affect the period of antibiotics administration, an excisional biopsy under local anesthesia was performed, and an acid-fast bacillus stain along with a culture study was carried out. Biopsy results revealed findings consistent with inflammatory granulation tissue and acid-fast bacillus staining which showed no specific findings. A culture study showed positive results for Staphylococcus aureus susceptible to methicillin. The lesion was concluded as a retropharyngeal abscess, and treatment with antibiotics was initiated with the administration of intravenous Cefazolin 2 g every 8 hours. The total treatment period with antibiotics was eight weeks. The follow-up evaluation with blood tests showed no abnormal findings regarding the WBC, ESR and CRP. Re-evaluation with cervical MRI after treatment with antibiotics showed improvement of a retropharyngeal abscess (). On video fluoroscopic swallowing study, aspiration was not observed, and the residual contents were remarkably decreased leading to initiation of feeding with a regular diet (). The cervical pain was managed with the administration of Tramadol HCL 18.75 mg/Acetaminophen 162.5 mg three times a day since admission but did not show improvement. However, the cervical pain started improving after the initiation of treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Medication with Tramadol HCL 18.75 mg/Acetaminophen 162.5 mg was administrated for a total period of four weeks, and the patient no longer complained of cervical pain.","{

"A 59-year-old female patient presented with fracture neck humerus along with absent pulsations in the left upper limb due to blunt trauma. Patient also had history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Colour Doppler study revealed monophasic flow in the upper limb arteries suggestive of proximal occlusion. Computed tomographic (CT) angiogram showed complete occlusion of the left axillary artery (Figures and ) by sharp edge of the fractured humerus and distal filling of brachial artery through collaterals. Although patient had absent pulsations in the upper limb, capillary refilling was there. Urgent surgical intervention was done in the form of fixation of fracture followed by repair of the axillary artery. Patient was operated under supraclavicular block; orthopedic team first did the open reduction and fixation of the neck of the humerus through a longitudinal incision over the anterolateral aspect of left shoulder. After fixation of fracture, vascular surgery team did the exploration of axillary artery. Axillary artery was explored in the left axilla through a separate incision other than that used for fixation of fracture. Longitudinal incision midway between anterior and posterior axillary folds was given and extended on to the medial aspect of the proximal arm. The axillary artery was found contused for a segment of approximately 8 cm; fortunately, there was no associated nerve injury and the basilic vein was also intact allowing us to use the basilic vein for repair of the axillary artery. Contused segment of the axillary artery was excised after taking proximal and distal control and after heparinization (1 mg/kg). Basilic vein of appropriate length was harvested through the same incision and axillary artery was repaired using reversed basilic vein graft in an end to end fashion using 6-0 polypropylene sutures (). Postprocedure pulsations were present in the left upper limb. Fasciotomy was not done as there was no evidence of compartment syndrome and the limb was not edematous. Total duration of procedure including both fixation of fracture and repair of the axillary artery was approximately three hours. Patient recovered well and came for follow-up three months after the procedure with palpable pulsations.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Admitted with acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery', 'Complained of pain in the left cervical region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': ''}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Doppler ultrasound (DUS)', 'Finding': 'Critical stenosis of the left ICA and 50-69% stenosis of the right ICA'}, {'Test': 'Angiography', 'Finding': 'Occlusion of the right ICA with reperfusion on vasa vasorum and 90% stenosis of the left ICA'}, {'Test': 'Blood culture', 'Finding': 'Vancomycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus'}, {'Test': 'Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)', 'Finding': 'Infection at the stent site'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Giant pseudoaneurysm of the treated artery', 'Type': 'Vascular complication', 'Location': 'Carotid artery'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Placement of Casper stent', 'Details': 'Dual-layer braided metal stent with micro-mesh to achieve arterial wall reconstruction'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Initial reduction in pseudoaneurysm flow and volume', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '', 'FunctionalStatus': ''}}}"
"A 74-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and interventricular septal hypertrophy underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement with concomitant septal myectomy. Two months after the surgical intervention she presented to another hospital with syncope. On presentation, it was described that this obese patient was bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute with stable blood pressure readings. No jugular venous distention was noted and occasional cannon A waves were noted. Examination of the lungs revealed adequate aeration in all fields with no crackles or wheezing. Point of maximum impulse was not displaced. Regular heart sounds with variable intensity were noted with no atrial or ventricular gallops but an early systolic murmur grade II/VI was described noted at the left sternal border. Due to the symptomatic bradycardia a dual chamber pacemaker was recommended and placed without complications. The patient was subsequently discharged home 24 hours after the pacemaker implantation. Four months post pacemaker implantation she was seen in follow-up and she doing fine and reported no complaints. An echocardiogram was obtained and it was reported that normal left ventricular systolic function as well as prosthetic aortic valve function were noted, with no other abnormalities.\nThe patient then relocated and was seen a year later for the first time at our institution. An echocardiogram obtained at the time of her initial visit, while still asymptomatic, showed normal left ventricular chamber dimensions, systolic function, and bioprosthetic valve function. In addition, a pacer wire that was correctly positioned in the right ventricular apex was also seen. However, an abnormal color flow signal arising from the interventricular septum with a predominant flow away from the transducer into the left ventricular cavity was noted. Continuous and pulse wave Doppler interrogation demonstrated a continuous flow with a predominant diastolic component, as shown in Figures , and , all these findings consistent with coronary arterial flow. This abnormal color flow signal, traversing the interventricular septum, was never identified in previous studies.\nThe patient presented in this case was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and consequently no intervention was recommended. The patient was seen in follow-up and was doing fine, reporting no complaints.","{

"A 43-year-old incarcerated woman with borderline personality disorder and a long history of swallowing various foreign objects in periods of stress presented to the emergency department after swallowing a cup of bleach. Her surgical history was significant for multiple celiotomies for retrievals of purposefully ingested foreign bodies. During evaluation, she also admitted to swallowing an ink pen 3 weeks prior to swallowing the bleach for which she did not seek medical evaluation. She reported no food intolerance or changes in bowel function secondary to swallowing these objects. She presented with mild abdominal pain and cramping, and her vital signs and laboratory investigations were all within normal limits. Her abdominal exam was notable for mild tenderness to palpation diffusely. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen () showed a linear foreign body in the distal gastric antrum penetrating the inferior wall and extending into the adjacent peritoneal fat. No free air or free fluid was appreciated. Initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was significant for mild erythema and edema to the esophageal and duodenal mucosa as a result of the caustic ingestion, and the pen was found to be deeply perforating the stomach antral wall with no associated ulcer or edema (). The depth at which the foreign body was lodged was uncertain, so there was concern for organ involvement outside of the gastric wall. Repeat EGD was done to assess for manifestations of esophageal, gastric or duodenal injuries from her caustic ingestion, and it revealed normal gastric mucosa (). A joint case was planned with the gastroenterology service for endoscopic foreign body retrieval, possible laparoscopic retrieval and gastric repair and possible open retrieval and gastric repair. The patient was taken to the operating room for the third EGD, which revealed spontaneous migration of the foreign body from the perforation site into the lumen of the gastric body (). Additionally, there was spontaneous closure of the site of previous perforation (). The ink pen was easily removed transorally using an endoscopic snare, and no further surgical intervention was required. After the procedure, the patient reported complete resolution of her abdominal pain and was able to tolerate a regular diet without problems.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Recurrent left lower extremity swelling'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousDVT': 'Deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity', 'HRT': 'History of hormone replacement therapy'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Venous Doppler ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending towards the left common iliac vein'}, {'Test': 'Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery, elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein suggesting May-Thurner Syndrome'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'May-Thurner Syndrome', 'Type': 'Vascular condition', 'Location': 'Left iliac vein compression'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'IVC stent placement', 'Details': 'Luminexx and Wallstent placement for left iliac vein stenosis, catheter directed thrombolysis for recurrent DVT'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complicated by stent migration and subsequent procedures', 'DischargeStatus': 'Rivaroxaban anticoagulation'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '5 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Residual postthrombotic syndrome managed with compression stockings'}}}"
"A 25-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic with a complaint of recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek of three-month duration. He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region. We suspected the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. A periapical view was then taken with gutta-percha inserted into the sinus for foreign body localization purpose. The radiograph revealed the gutta-percha pointed towards the site of titanium plate and screws placed used for rigid fixation, and with the molar orthodontic tube appliance in its vicinity (). A cone beam CT was performed to provide a 3D detailed location of the appliance (Figures and ) and confirmed it to be located outside the maxillary antrum.\nThe presence of the molar orthodontic tube foreign body reaction was suspected as the most probable cause of the recurrent right cheek pain and swelling associated with an intraoral discharging sinus. Exploration of the site was performed through the sulcular incision under general anesthesia. The dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap. It was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. Just below it, one titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was inspected and found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone. However, a decision was made to remove them based on the fact that they are present in an infected area. (). The Le Fort I osteotomy site showed good healing with new bone formation. Patient had an uneventful recovery thereafter, and the orthognathic surgical team who attended him previously was informed of his progress.","{

"A 27-year-old man with a 2-year history of recurrent hospitalizations for various neurologic and cardiologic emergencies was admitted to our hospital presenting with left hemiparesis, which gradually progressed to quadriparesis, bilateral hemianopsia, intracranial hypertension syndrome, and seizures. A diagnosis of echinococcosis was made, based on the radiologic findings of multiple cerebral hydatid cysts and a sizable cyst of the heart (\n). The hydatid cyst of the heart was treated first with a thoracotomy, and after a month, he underwent three consecutive surgical operations for the removal of the six cerebral cysts. The patient was on albendazole treatment throughout his hospitalization, and this led to the shrinkage and finally to the disappearance of two other cerebral cysts.\nDuring the first surgical procedure, two frontal hydatid cysts were completely removed via a right frontal craniotomy and another cyst of the occipital lobe was removed via a separate right occipital craniotomy (\n). The patient initially had an uneventful postoperative recovery but 2 weeks later, while the second operation was being planned, he presented with generalized seizures (with loss of consciousness and urinary incontinence). Emergent cerebral CT scan revealed a marked expansion of the left occipital lobe cyst, cerebral edema, and midline shift (\n). A possible explanation of this event is that the removal of the contralateral (right occipital) cyst disturbed the pressure balance between these two lesions and allowed the expansion of the left occipital cyst toward the right side. The patient was emergently operated on and a left occipital craniotomy was performed for the complete removal of the left occipital cyst. There were no postoperative events, and 10 days later the third procedure was performed. A right cerebellar hemisphere cyst was removed via a right suboccipital craniectomy, and a left frontal lobe cyst was removed via a left frontal craniotomy (\n).\nThe patient's focal neurologic signs eventually disappeared, with the exception of a slight unilateral hemianopsia. Ten years after his discharge, he remains in a good condition, with no signs of clinical or radiologic relapse.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe sudden-onset left-sided retro-orbital headache with blurry vision in left eye', 'Altered sensation in right lower extremity'], 'MedicalHistory': {'History': 'Depression and daily tobacco use'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Non-contrast CT head', 'Finding': 'Bilateral internal carotid artery dissections with left pseudoaneurysm'}, {'Test': 'CT angiograms of neck and brain', 'Finding': 'Bilateral internal carotid artery dissections'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Bilateral internal carotid artery dissections with left pseudoaneurysm', 'Type': 'Vascular disorder', 'Location': 'Internal carotid artery'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Heparin drip, stent placement', 'Details': 'Stent placed in left internal carotid artery, discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Stable right internal carotid artery dissection, patent left carotid stent'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Four weeks', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Stable with medication management'}}}"
"A 52-year-old female patient presented with pain in both the hip joints since 3 months. She was unable to walk, stand, climb, or do any activities with her lower limbs.\nShe had undergone bilateral TKR in July 2012 for severe OA of both the knees. She was assured that she would be able to walk freely after the surgery. No mention was made about the existing disease in the hip joints and about the need to operate both the hips. One month into the post-operative period after TKR the patient was totally unable to walk and was reduced to a wheel chair existence. Prior to surgery she was able to walk and do her day to day activities with pain. Even this was not possible after the surgery. When the patient went back to the surgeon seeking remedy, she was told that she needs to undergo bilateral hip replacement in order to walk again. When asked why this was not told to her earlier there was no response. When patient expressed her unwillingness for the surgery due to the previous bad experience and also due to extreme financial crunch to muster money for another twin replacement surgery. She was told to return back once she would not arrange money and until such time continue taking the pain killer. On request for any alternative method of treatment, the surgeon categorically said nothing could be done. It is then the patient approached me for treatment.\nOn enquiry, she told me that she was an old patient of RA and was on treatment since 2009. She did not have typical RA presentation and her problems started as pain in both the knees unlike a typical RA small joint presentation. Subsequently she did develop pain in the hands, feet, shoulder, hip, and wrist but hip the presentation was unlike a typical RA. Her RA test was 26 u/ml and the normal reading was up to 15 u/ml. Her other blood parameters and X-rays did not support the diagnosis of RA [].\nIn 2009, she underwent a diagnostic arthroscopy for pain in both the knees since 3 months. During the diagnostic arthroscopy she was diagnosed left medial meniscus tear with synovitis and partial medial meniscectomy, synovectomy and chondroplasty was done on 19/1/09. She had no fall or trauma to the left knee. She had no history of swelling etc., of the knee. Clinically, she was not diagnosed to have medial meniscus torn and no magnetic resonance imaging was done prior to arthroscopy. She always complained of bilateral knee pain and not a single joint pain. After the surgery, there was no relief in her pain in the knees and she was put on anti RA treatment by another orthopedic surgeon. She was also diagnosed to have diabetes and hypertension and was taking of treatment for these ailments also.\nHer pain in both the knees steadily increased until 2012 despite taking regular treatment for RA such as methotrexate, folic acid. By then she had developed pain in the hands, hips, wrist, and shoulders. On July 2012 she was advised to undergo bilateral TKR and the diagnosis mentioned was severe bilateral OA! The X-ray reports have also suggested that the patient had OA knees and hips and lumbar spondylosis but her RA factor had shot up to 90 IU/ml (normal 0-30) on 4/7/12 and by 17/11/12 it had dropped to <10.4 IU/ml. Radiologists did not diagnose RA of the hips and knees, but a vague juxta-articular rarefaction in the hands was mentioned. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 98, 103, 75 mm/h in 2011, July 2012, November 12 respectively. The radiology report on 23/8/12 had severe OA changes in both knees and hips.\nPatient was wheel chair bounded []. Her pain in both the hips as per the Numerical Pain Analog scale was nine. She had 86% disability in the hip as per the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Score for the Knee Joint WOMAC score. She had Grade 3 tenderness in both the hips and the movements of the hip were severely restricted. Flexion - 50°, abduction - 10°, adduction - 50°. Flexion - 10°, external rotation - nil, internal rotation - nil, extension - 5°. Her walking time was 2 minutes 20 seconds for 50 meters [].\nShe was put on 30 days integrated physiotherapy consisting of ultrasound, interferential therapy and moist heat and IAYT practices and data's were collected, after 10th day, 20th days and 30th day []. She improved steadily in all the clinical parameters and she was off the wheel chair by the 3rd day and graduated to walking with the support on both sides [], one side support [] by 7th day as by 10th day she was walking without support []. Her pain also steadily decreased from 9 to 2 by the end of 3 weeks. She expressed satisfaction at the outcome of the treatment as she had progressed from wheel chair to independent walking and that too after being told she had no other alternative!","{

"Our patient is a 16-year-old otherwise healthy male who sustained an injury to the left leg while playing football, 2 years before presentation. He was found to have a left distal third oblique tibia fracture () and was splinted in an outside emergency department that evening. Soon after, he was transitioned to a cast which remained in place for 6 weeks, and then to a boot for an additional 4 weeks. The patient then returned to playing football and did well, with mild occasional symptoms of aching pain for approximately 2 years.\nTwo years after the initial injury, the patient was tackled from the side while playing football. He had immediate pain in the left tibia in the same location of the previous fracture. The pain persisted for approximately 6 months. It was localized to the site of the prior tibia fracture and extended to the anterior aspect of the foot. The patient also noted occasional numbness and tingling in the tips of his toes.\nInitial assessment at the time of presentation to our institution showed the left lower extremity to be grossly normal in appearance, with no swelling or deformity. The patient had tenderness to palpation along the left distal tibia. He had no neurologic deficit, with normal motor and sensory function throughout the lower extremities. Vascular exam was also normal.\nRadiographs showed an apparent channel in the lateral aspect of the distal tibia, consistent with a partial nonunion; however, the remainder of the fracture appeared well-healed ().\nA CT scan was obtained for further evaluation and showed a tubular channel running through the lateral cortex of the distal third of the tibia, at the previous fracture site (). The appearance was consistent with entrapment of the neurovascular bundle, warranting further imaging with an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ().\nMRI demonstrated the anterior tibial artery and deep peroneal nerve embedded within the lateral distal tibial cortex ().\nGiven the patient’s persistent pain at the fracture site and concern for entrapment of the neurovascular bundle in the setting of partial nonunion, surgical intervention was offered. The decision was made to proceed with exploration and removal of the neurovascular bundle from within the cortical bone. We discussed that if the artery appeared to be coursing through the bone, it would likely not be functional. Given his foot remained well perfused, bypass was not planned (even if the anterior tibial artery was nonfunctional).\nA longitudinal incision was made along the distal third of the anterior tibial crest of the left leg. Sharp dissection was carried down through the floor of the anterior tibialis tendon sheath. The periosteum was elevated using a Cobb elevator, to expose the anterior tibial artery and deep peroneal nerve. Exploration of the deep peroneal nerve showed it to be adherent to the periosteum, but not encased within the bone. The nerve was mobilized and neurolyzed throughout the entire zone of injury. The nerve was protected for the remainder of the procedure. The anterior tibial artery was encased in bone, entering the tibial cortex approximately 9 cm above the tibiotalar joint and exiting approximately 4 cm above the tibiotalar joint ().\nAn osteotome was used to create a trough in the tibia, extending from the entrance and exit points of the anterior tibial artery. The artery was easily removed from the bone after creation of the trough and was left in continuity. The artery was found to be non-pulsatile when the tourniquet was released. The patient was placed in a soft dressing and allowed to weight bear as tolerated in a walking boot.\nThe post-operative course was uncomplicated. The patient was seen at 6 weeks postoperatively. He reported significant improvement in his pain compared to preoperatively. He had been wearing the boot while out of the house. He had not yet returned to sporting activities.

"An 80-year-old male was referred to us with squamous cell carcinoma of the left pre-auricular area that was confirmed through incisional biopsy (). The patient was suffering from occasional bleeding, discharge, and repeated ulceration of the lesion. We performed computed tomography of the head and neck region before surgery, which showed no evidence of invasion. We performed wide excision of the tumor with a 0.5 cm lateral margin throughout. We obtained a safe margin of depth without parotid gland injury even though the tumor bed was close to the parotid gland fascia (). However, we could not completely rule out micro-injuries to the parotid gland fascia although we reserved parotid gland fascia. After wide excision, the skin defect was covered with a 5×6 cm full thickness skin graft from the left inguinal area. The usual compression dressing with a tie-over suture was applied to maintain the skin graft.\nOn the fifth postoperative day, we discovered exudate from the base of the skin graft through the slit incision site (). The dressing materials were wet and the discharge from the operative site increased during meals. The amount of discharge was approximately 50 mL, and its amylase level was 200,000 unit/L. Accordingly, we confirmed the exudate was salivary discharge and he was diagnosed with a sialo-cutaneous fistula.\nWe decided to use botulinum toxin type A injection because of concern for graft failure due to increased sialorrhea that was not controlled by conventional compression dressings. Using a tuberculin syringe, we administered a transcutaneous injection of 25 IU of the toxin at a point 0.5 cm above the site of the fistula at the surgical incision line and administered another 25 IU injection 0.5 cm anterior from that point. The injections were performed only for the superficial parotid gland in order to avoid post injection facial nerve paralysis. The discharge draining from the sialo-cutaneous fistula was considerably reduced after the second day of injection. The patient fully recovered within a week without any complications such as graft shearing or failure ().","{

"A 55-year-old male who was a known case of cancer of floor of mouth came to the outpatient department with complaints of difficulty in swallowing and burning sensation in the oral cavity for the past 3 months. The pain was insidious in onset, burning, and stinging in nature and radiating to the earlobe. The patient reported that he had not taken his meals properly for the past 10 days and appeared very distressed. He reported restriction in mouth opening and alteration of taste for the past 3 months. He, therefore, was not on any medications as oral intake was very poor. He revealed that he had consumed lice poison (pyrethrins) 5 days back, while feeling hopeless due to his pain.\nThe patient was diagnosed 1 year ago, when he presented in the head and neck clinic with an ulcer in the floor of his mouth for 6 months. He had also noticed swelling in the neck for the same duration. The patient noticed a change in voice for the past 1 month, and he also reported that recently a painful ulcer had developed inside his right cheek. He was evaluated by a biopsy which revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell cancer.\nPatient was planned for palliative radiotherapy and received five fractions recently. His previous radical radiotherapy session was in September 2017.\nThe patient reported that he developed severe ulceration and burning sensation in his mouth after his radiotherapy.\nThe patient had been a follow-up case of pain clinic since 2016 and was started on morphine 4 h along with adjuncts such as paracetamol and gabapentin, and the dose was subsequently increased after the period when he received radiotherapy. He was late to his follow-up this time, admitted that due to some personal issues, he could not come on time.\nOn speaking with him alone, he confessed that he consumed the poison when he was alone and was suffering from intolerable pain. He repeatedly ensured that there was no emotional distress that he suffered other than the pain. He was thankful to God that his family members were very supportive. There were no attempts like this in the past.\nOn discussion with his eldest son who was accompanying him, his statements echoed with what his father had told. He was upset that his father resorted to poisoning himself because of the pain and requested painkillers. He told that he has never left his father's side since then.\nA personal history showed that the patient was a smoker for the past 40 years, 1 pack/day. He was an alcoholic for the past 40 years and had a consumption of about 50 ml every day. The patient also reported disturbed sleep for 6 months.\nA history showed that the patient was a diabetic, diagnosed 6 months ago. He was not on any antidiabetic medication.\nA psychosocial history showed that the patient had four children, of them two were married. Two girls who were married lived with their families in the same town. The patient had a supporting wife; both the husband and the wife lived with their two sons and their families in the same house. The family knew about the diagnosis and were involved actively in the treatment since the diagnosis of the disease.\nOn examination, the patient seemed anxious, avoided eye contact, and was teary during the whole conversation. He was conscious, oriented, and alert. There was mild pallor. There was an ulceroproliferative growth 6 cm × 5 cm in the floor of the mouth on the undersurface of the tongue with restricted mouth opening, admitting only two fingers. There were areas of white patches involving the buccal mucosa and the tongue. There were intermittent areas of erythema over the buccal mucosa as well as the lips. There was no bleeding. There were multiple ulcers present on the floor of the mouth, the buccal mucosa, and the hard palate. Oral mucositis WHO grade IV was present. The oral hygiene was poor. There was halitosis.\nThe patient was admitted in the ward and he was started on morphine infusion. The intravenous infusion was titrated according to the patient's response. He was advised triple gargle (concoction containing syrup Benadryl, lignocaine viscous, and sodium bicarbonate is an indigenous preparation used in low-income countries for oral hygiene) six times a day and was instructed to maintain proper oral hygiene. The patient was counseled on a daily basis and his mental functioning was noted on the basis of being able to perform his daily activities, and his spiritual and psychosocial pain was addressed. A psychology consult in this patient was not deemed necessary as the suicide attempt was due to pain and the patient when admitted in ward was under full supervision, while being titrated with pain medication.\nThe patient was seen on follow-up visit after 2 weeks and was found to be feeling better. He seemed pain free. He reported that he was more functional after the discharge and felt happy about himself and his family.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Pain at the left side of the base of the penis after excessive forceful masturbation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant past injuries'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Physical Examination', 'Finding': 'Small hematoma at the base of the penis, distended bladder, painful scrotum with normal testicles'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Tear in the tunica albuginea and hematoma in the left side of the base of the penis'}, {'Test': 'Blood Culture', 'Finding': 'Staphylococcus aureus infection'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Penile Trauma - Rupture of the cavernous body', 'Type': 'Traumatic injury', 'Location': 'Penis'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative management with antibiotics and heparin', 'Details': 'Broad spectrum antibiotics and low molecular weight heparin, drainage and surgical debridement of abscess'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Abscess drained spontaneously, relief from pain, normal blood count', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged after 12 days with oral antibiotics for 10 more days'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '3 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Normal erections reported, no other complications reported'}}}"
"A 25-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic with a complaint of recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek of three-month duration. He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region. We suspected the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. A periapical view was then taken with gutta-percha inserted into the sinus for foreign body localization purpose. The radiograph revealed the gutta-percha pointed towards the site of titanium plate and screws placed used for rigid fixation, and with the molar orthodontic tube appliance in its vicinity (). A cone beam CT was performed to provide a 3D detailed location of the appliance (Figures and ) and confirmed it to be located outside the maxillary antrum.\nThe presence of the molar orthodontic tube foreign body reaction was suspected as the most probable cause of the recurrent right cheek pain and swelling associated with an intraoral discharging sinus. Exploration of the site was performed through the sulcular incision under general anesthesia. The dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap. It was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. Just below it, one titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was inspected and found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone. However, a decision was made to remove them based on the fact that they are present in an infected area. (). The Le Fort I osteotomy site showed good healing with new bone formation. Patient had an uneventful recovery thereafter, and the orthognathic surgical team who attended him previously was informed of his progress.","{

"A 52-year-old female achondroplasia patient (body height 130 centimeters) was referred for orthopaedic treatment with a symptomatic leg length difference after bilateral total hip arthroplasty. Her medical history contained psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as well as several orthopedic operations in the course of her underlying disease. During childhood and adolescence, she had undergone several surgical procedures due to recurrent bilateral dislocation of the patella including bilateral varus osteotomy of the distal femur. Apart from orthopedic issues, no other complications from achondroplasia were apparent.\nDysplastic cox arthrosis affecting both hip joints had been treated with bilateral hip replacement surgery. The first prosthesis was implanted on the right hip without any perioperative complications eight years prior to presentation at our clinic. Hip replacement surgery on the left side was carried out six years after total hip arthroplasty on the right side. A postoperative overlength of five centimeters of the left femur resulted whereas prior to the procedure the leg length had been balanced out.\nAt our clinic, the patient presented with a limping gait pattern and complained about constant pain in the left hip ¡oint as well as intense and motion dependent lower back pain. Activities of daily living were possible only with extreme difficulty. A heel elevation of three centimeters had been tried temporarily on the right side, but did not prove to be sufficient for the patient. Both hip implants were found to be stable with no radiological signs of loosening. A postoperative overlength of the left femur (70 centimeters versus 65 centimeters) was apparent while the tibiae were of approximately equal length with both leg axes in slight (normo)-varus positions.\nThe patient had become well adapted to her short stature during lifetime and did not feel any strain for increasing her body height. Now she was eager to cope with everyday life again - as she had been before her second total hip arthroplasty. The possible therapeutic options were evaluated and discussed with the patient. We advised for right leg lengthening. The patient strongly opposed and refused the operation, mentioning friends with short stature history who underwent lengthening procedures. She did not want to “suffer the same complications” and lengthening treatment schedule.\nInformed consent for a distal femoral shortening osteotomy of the left lower limb was obtained. Shortening of the distal femur by five cm was performed using a Low Compression Plate with angle stability (LCP DF, Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland) for osteotomy fixation. There were no perioperative complications. In the postoperative course, the patient was instructed in 15 kilograms weight bearing and was mobilized with full range of motion. The patient was discharged in good medical condition with clean wound conditions four days after surgery. At the follow-up six weeks later, the patient presented with a balanced leg length. Three month after surgery the osteotomy was healed and the patient was allowed full weight bearing. Walking without crutches was reached four months after the operation.\nOne year after surgery, the control radiograph showed a fully consolidated osteotomy. In the gait analysis, the gait pattern was normal showing no signs of instability and the patient managed walking on uneven ground without difficulty. The straight leg raise test was performed without any signs of a muscular deficit. During the chair rising test, neither assistance nor support by the upper extremity was needed. Active bending of the knee joint was performed with good muscular strength. The patient was entirely satisfied with the postoperative result.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Routine mammography screening revealed multiple lesions in both breasts', 'Palpable masses in upper outer quadrant of right breast and one in left breast'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalHistory': 'None reported'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Mammography and core biopsy', 'Finding': 'Grade I invasive ductal carcinoma in both breasts, with lymphoma-like features in right breast'}, {'Test': 'Staging CT scan', 'Finding': 'Normal'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma', 'Type': 'Indolent tumor', 'Location': 'Right breast, involving lymph nodes of both axillae'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Right mastectomy, axillary node clearance, wide local excision and axillary node sampling on left', 'Details': 'Radiotherapy to conserved left breast, adjuvant hormonal therapy for grade I invasive ductal carcinoma'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No lymphatic spread of breast cancer into axillae', 'DischargeStatus': 'No further treatment recommended for lymphoma'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six monthly intervals', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient remains under surveillance for recurrence or progression'}}}"
"A 45 year old woman had a bariatric gastric bypass surgical operation. A few years before the operation she had a weight of 192 kg (BMI 65). Over a two years period she was able to reduce her weight to 149 kg. This preoperative weight of 149 kg was stable over the last four months before the gastric bypass operation. She had a medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and severe psoriasis. She had also been hospitalised with erysipelas and ulcers on the lower extremities a few years prior to having gastric bypass surgery.\nThough she received postoperative advice from a dietician about the importance of eating a vitamin rich diet, she continued with an insufficient diet in order to obtain further weight loss. Three months postoperatively she had lost further 20 kg in weight. At the same time she began to develop painful swelling, bruising and small ulcers on the lower extremities. She was hospitalised at the local hospital with fever one week after these symptoms appeared. Within the next 24 hours she developed purpura on the lower extremities and a sepsis like condition. Due to this she was transferred to Intensive care unit (ICU) at Odense University hospital. Within days she developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome with cerebral, respiratory, circulatory and renal failure. It was necessary to intubate and ventilate the patient and renal failure was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). To restore the circulation it was necessary to treat the patient with a large amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressor agents. Infected leg ulcers were suspected to be the focus for sepsis. After appropriate samples of blood and secretion were taken for cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotic was initiated. No bacteria occurred in the cultures and the patient showed no signs of improvement on antibiotic therapy. In contrast the changes in the skin progressed with increasing erythema, and ecchymosis forming a painful, confluent purpuric plaques and bullae. Minimal trauma to the skin resulted in petechiae and confluent purpuric plaques. It was estimated that 30% of the skin was affected by confluent purpuric plaques. As a result of these haemorrhagic bullae the patient was continuously bleeding from the skin. On the worst days the blood loss from the skin was estimated to be 61 per day. In addition to blood loss the patient lost a large amount of fluid from the skin-estimated on the worst days to be 201 per day. The patient’s lips were covered with haemorrhagic crust but no major gingival bleeding was observed. Skin biopsy was performed. This biopsy showed diffuse extravasation of erythrocytes but no hyperkeratosis or “corkscrew hair”. The subdermal tissue was vital. A biopsy from the bone marrow was without any sign of malignancy.\nOver the three weeks in the ICU it became obvious that the skin changes and the massive loss of blood and fluid from the skin were not in accordance with a diagnosis of sepsis. It was proposed that the massive bleeding from the skin might be due to scurvy. A blood sample for the analysis of serum-ascorbic acid levels was taken and the patient was treated with enteral ascorbic acid at a dose of 2 g per day. The blood sample showed a serum-ascorbic acid concentration of 6.6 (normal range 26 - 85 μmol per l). After two days of vitamin-C treatment the patient’s condition began gradually to improve. The skin changes gradually disappeared, haemodynamics improved, the patient regained her renal function and could be weaned from the ventilator. A few weeks after the start of ascorbic acid treatment the patient could be transferred to the medical ward.","{

"An 84-year-old white female underwent surgical repair of a macular hole in her left eye. The surgery consisted of a vitrectomy followed by the instillation of a mixture of C3F8 gas and sterile air into the vitreous cavity. After such a procedure, the patient is asked to maintain a face-down position for several days, which facilitates hole closure and improves vision. The gas bubble is then gradually absorbed over a period of weeks and the eye returns to a fluid-filled state. The patient's past medical history was notable for long-standing coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a past surgical history of right carotid endarterectomy. The surgery was uneventful, but on postoperative day one the pressure in the eye was elevated. The surgeon performed an anterior chamber paracentesis to normalize the pressure. That evening the patient presented to the ED with a headache and symptomatic bradycardia with a heart rate of 25. She was noted to have high-grade AV block with AV dissociation and intermittent idioventricular escape. She underwent implantation of a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker, which corrected her dysrhythmia. During this period of time she was unable to maintain the recommended position for the retinal surgery.\nHer retinal surgeon was not informed of these events and she was ultimately seen again on postoperative day five. On that visit her anterior chamber was flat. (The iris and her intraocular lens had been pushed forward against the back of the cornea. This was an indication that the gas bubble had significantly expanded or she had been positioning improperly, with the bubble pushing up against the front of the eye rather than back toward the macular hole.) The pressure in the eye was markedly elevated to 88 (normal being up to 21). The ophthalmologist lowered the pressure to the normal range by withdrawing gas from the vitreous cavity. Later that day the patient developed acute mental status changes and again presented to the ED. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated intracranial air in addition to the gas bubble in the eye (). She was referred to a tertiary care center where it was opined that the intraocular gas bubble had expanded and tracked along the optic nerve, eventually entering the brain. This was likely due to the use of an expansile gas concentration during the surgery. The intracranial air gradually resolved, as did her mental status changes, but the involved eye lost all vision due to high pressure maintained over an extended period of time.\nA case of pneumocephalus following macula hole repair has previously been published in the ophthalmology literature because it was opined that an incorrect gas concentration was instilled in the eye, resulting in marked expansion of the gas bubble []. Our case is presented here because gas bubbles are frequently used in retinal surgery, and there are specific management issues that apply to such patients in the ED. To our knowledge there is no discussion of such cases in the emergency medicine literature.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Progressive gluteal swelling and chronic lower back pain'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Congenital cyst removed in infancy, hysterectomy and oophorectomy for fibroid and benign ovarian cyst 17 years prior'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Large multiloculated cyst in ischiorectal fossa'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Solid mass at right adnexa, inguinal lymph node enlargement'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Mucinous adenocarcinoma arising within a cystic hamartoma', 'Type': 'Primary', 'Location': 'Gluteal area'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'XELOX chemotherapy', 'Details': '5 cycles completed, followed by palliative radiotherapy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Significant interval progression with recurrence', 'DischargeStatus': 'Referred to radiation oncology for palliative care'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '10 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Poor performance status, refused further treatment'}}}"
"A female patient aged 11 years had reported to the hospital with her parents with complaint of presence of extra mouth since birth. They were embarrassed and had been not treated well by others in the village, thought it to be a bad omen, and came to remove it. There were no other specific problems due to the extra mouth. The patient was brushing that accessory mouth.\nOn examination there were two oral cavities, one normal and other accessory.\nOn extra oral examination of the normal oral cavity, the upper and lower lips were normal. The maxilla was normal. The mandible was asymmetrical due to the bony prominence.\nOn intra oral examination the buccal and labial vestibules of the maxilla were normal. In mandible, the buccal vestibule was normal, but the depth of the labial vestibule was obliterated due to the prominent presence of the accessory oral cavity. The maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth were in normal occlusion, but the mandibular anterior teeth were present at the right side were inclined lingually, but in the left side lower anterior teeth were normally placed.\nThe position was elevated at the right side due to the presence of the cystic lesion of the floor of the mouth, which extends from the midline to right retromolar region. But there was no disturbance in normal swallowing. The tongue movement was normal. Speech was normal.\nOn extra oral examination, the accessory oral cavity was situated below the lower lip of the normal oral cavity on the right symphysis region. There were small upper and lower lips fused at the angle. The right angle was situated 1 cm below the right angle of the normal oral cavity and the left angle was crossing the normal midline extending ½ cm on the left symphysis region. There was skin present in between the lower lip of the normal oral cavity and the accessory upper lip.\nOn intra oral examination in the center of the accessory oral cavity there was a bony prominence with the presence of seven lower anterior teeth with gingival attachment. The base of the bony prominence was fused with the labial surface of the mandible of normal oral cavity. There were associated right and left buccal and labial vestibules. Salivary discharge too found.\nThe patient was not able to swallow through that accessory mouth and was able to move both the upper and lower lips of that accessory oral cavity and able to approximate both the lips of the same [Figures –].\nCT Examination shows excessive growth of mandible with presence of cystic swelling and radiolucency on the lingual surface of mandible extending from the midline to right angle of mandible [Figures –].\n3D CT shows excessive bony growth over the labial surface of the mandible [].\nUnder nasoendotracheal intubation first crevicular incision from 32 to 43 was put and labial gingiva with alveolar mucosa was reflected completely and bone exposed to lower border of mandible. During the procedure labial mucosa attached to the bony prominence over accessory mouth was incised and bony prominence was brought to normal oral cavity.\nThere were seven teeth resembling lower permanent anterior teeth. Then excision of accessory lips was done around the vermilion border. Inside the oral cavity 41 was extracted and through that socket osteotomy done. Vertical incisions were put over 41 extracted site and between 43 and 44 and horizontally connected half cm below the lower border of bony prominence of accessory mouth. The lesion was displaced lingually and mylohyoid muscle exposed and able to see dermoid cyst both below and above the mylohyoid muscle. Through the same approach excised the entire dermoid cyst. During the excision could see one small rudimentary tongue approximately 1-1/2 × 1 cm which was attached with the lining mucosa of dermoid cyst. There were multiple calcified granules and hair follicles filled with straw colored fluid. This dermoid cyst was attached on the lingual surface of the excised accessory bony prominence and there was communication from the dermoid cyst to the oral cavity. There was separate blood supply to the mouth. The excised specimen was sent for biopsy. Closure was done intraorally with 3-0 chromic catgut and normal labial lower vestibule was reconstructed. The outer skin layer was approximated with lower portion of the skin of original lower lips with 3-0 black silk. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient went home happy [Figures –].\nRevealed teratoma with presence of multiple small bony granules and hair follicles and teeth. The rudimentary tongue too was confirmed by the pathologist [Figures –].","{

"A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe right abdominal pain for 4 months. A fixed stony-hard tumor of about 100 mm in diameter was found on palpation, with slight tenderness on the right side of her abdomen. A full blood examination gave values within the normal limit. Abdominal CT showed a large mass with diffuse calcification of size about 130 × 110 mm in the right retroperitoneal space between the right kidney and the inferior vena cava, with slight hydronephrosis (). Lymph node swelling, ascites, liver tumor, and lung tumor were not detected by chest and abdominal CT, and the patient had no history of trauma or radiation therapy at the tumor site. However, the patient had undergone bilateral resection of tumors of the adrenal glands on the left side at the age of 46 years old and on the right side at at the age of 50 years old. Pathological findings revealed that both adrenal gland tumors were pheochromocytoma and no adjuvant therapy was administered. This led to a preoperative diagnosis of recurrent pheochromocytoma or retroperitoneal osteosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. There were no carcinomas or sarcomas in her history or in her family history.\nComplete surgical resection of the primary tumor was performed. The tumor was situated behind the mesenterium of the ascending colon, compressing the right kidney, but no direct invasion of the surrounding organs was observed: there was no lymph node swelling, ascites or peritoneal dissemination, and the tumor was not present in the parenchyma of the liver and the kidney. The surgical margin was determined based on the rough connective tissue surrounding the tumor. Dissection of lymph nodes was not performed.\nGross examination revealed a rounded, bony, and hard tumor of size about 140 × 110 × 80 mm and weight 1100 g that was yellowish-white in color (). Histologically, the tumor consisted of a mixture of dense fibrous tissue, woven bone, and atypical cartilage. Some osteoclastic giant cells were observed. Woven bone trabeculae were arranged irregularly and were anastomosed to each other. The architecture of the woven bone trabeculae displayed a reverse zoning phenomenon, with mature bony tissue in the center and less mature bony tissue in the periphery. Although the cellularity of spindle cells within the fibrous tissue was not greatly increased, these cells showed mild but definite nuclear atypism with hyperchromasia and scattered mitotic figures. There was no evidence of fatty differentiation of these cells, indicating the absence of a well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Operative findings showed no continuity with skeletal bones, leading to a final diagnosis of well-differentiated (low-grade) extraskeletal osteosarcoma of the retroperitoneum (Figures and ).\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. We recommended adjuvant therapy because of the probable poor prognosis, but the patient refused radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patient was followed up by CT every 6 months without receiving adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\nThirty-one months after the operation, she was readmitted to our hospital due to severe pain in the lumbar region and the right lower leg. Abdominal CT revealed a large mass in the right retroperitoneal space. No calcification was seen, but recurrence of the primary tumor was strongly suspected. Surgical resection of the recurrent tumor was performed via a transabdominal approach, in which a tumor with adherence to the right kidney was completely removed, a procedure of tumor resection and right nephrectomy. Grossly, the recurrent retroperitoneal tumor adherent to the right kidney was of size 310 × 300 mm, with necrosis and hemorrhage and a yellowish-white color on the cut surface. The recurrent tumor was characterized histologically by proliferation of atypical nonepithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. The mitotic count of the neoplastic cells was about 50 per 10 high-power fields. Anaplastic features predominated, but a few foci of matrix production looked like osteoid or hyalinized collagen within the recurrent neoplastic tissues. These findings led to a diagnosis of high-grade malignant anaplastic spindle cell sarcoma, consistent with the recurrence of extraskeletal osteosarcoma (). There were no malignant findings in the kidney. The abdominal CT scan did not show an apparent recurrent tumor until the 30th month after the initial operation and there were no established tumor markers for extraskeletal osteosarcoma. We thought that the recurrent tumor had increased rapidly in one month and the pathological findings for the tumor were compatible with this conclusion. The patient was discharged on the 18th postoperative day, but 2 months later she was re-admitted due to severe back pain. Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally, but gradually she complained of dyspnea and received intravenous morphine hydrochloride for sedation. Chest and abdominal CT showed a lesion corresponding to the location of the primary tumor, together with multiple lung nodules and right pleural effusion. Gradually her general status worsened and the patient died due to widespread metastasis 33 months after the initial operation.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Fall on head at 10 months of age', 'Subsequent weakness on right side of face, arm, and leg'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'MRI Brain', 'Finding': 'Acute infarct involving left capsuloganglionic region'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Acute Infarct', 'Type': 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Location': 'Left capsuloganglionic region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative management with osmotic diuretics and anticoagulant therapy', 'Details': 'Low molecular weight heparin for 5 days'}, 'Postoperative Course': {}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '10 days', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Good clinical resolution with power 5/5 in right upper and lower limbs'}}}"
"A 33-year-old-male patient presented initially with lower abdominal pain in March 2006. He was diagnosed with appendicitis based upon his exam and history. A CT scan of the abdomen was performed at that time and demonstrated extensive inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant with possible interloop abscess (). Two nonspecific calcifications were noted radiographically and the differential diagnosis included appendicitis, ileitis, or diverticulitis. He did not have any urinary complaints at that time. He underwent an uneventful open appendectomy and had resolution of his initial symptoms and no further follow up.\nThe patient presented again in August 2011 with right flank pain and urinary symptoms. A noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen was performed and demonstrated a right ureterovesicular junction calculus with mild right ureteral dilation (). Again, calcifications were noted near the anterior fundus of the bladder (). He was managed medically and discharged with instructions to follow up with an urologist as an outpatient.\nHe subsequently presented again 3 weeks later with severe abdominal pain and induration of his lower abdominal wall. CT imaging now demonstrated interval enlargement of a complex cystic mass inseparable from the anterior superior wall of the urinary balder and abutting the posterior margin of the abdominal wall (). The radiographic diagnosis was an urachal remnant abscess versus tumor. He denied any urologic complaints at that time. He was started on antibiotics, and surgical consultation was performed. After an extensive discussion with the patient regarding his radiographic diagnosis and suspicion of complications related to an urachal remnant, he was scheduled for cystoscopy and surgical exploration.\nAt the time of surgery, cystoscopy did not demonstrate any abnormalities of the bladder. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and an indurated mass and abscess were encountered near the area of the anterior abdominal wall and bladder. The abscess was drained and a few small calcifications were encountered and removed for pathologic examination. A complete exploration was performed and the phlegmon appeared to be limited to the dome of the bladder. This area was excised and the dome of the bladder was closed primarily in layers with absorbable suture. Drains were placed and the abdominal wall was debrided and closed. He had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Final pathology demonstrated urachal remnants with no evidence of malignancy.","{

"Susan is a 51-year-old woman. As an adolescent, she developed scoliosis. Working as a hairstylist when she was 18 or 19, she began to have severe pain in her hands, making her work very difficult. She had carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand which provided temporary relief. Her symptoms slowly returned and she continued to have intense pain and difficulty with her daily activities. Seeking relief from her symptoms, she received treatment from chiropractors and Chinese medicine practitioners with no significant benefit. She also tried yoga and swimming but depending on the yoga movements or swimming strokes, she began to have more pain.\nWhen she was in her early forties, she began to have weakness in the lower half of her body. Her legs would frequently give out on the stairs, causing her to fall. Control of her bladder and bowel function also began to deteriorate. She had an MRI, and based on the results, she was scheduled for emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. She was informed that it would be an outpatient surgery and she would be home the same day.\nIn May 2011, Susan had a 6-level cervical spine fusion to stabilize her spine and relieve pressure on her spinal cord. When she woke up, she realized something was wrong. The entire right side of her body was paralyzed. What was supposed to be an outpatient surgery with a return home the same day ended up being an 8-week hospital and rehabilitation stay to learn how to walk again.\nIn August 2012, a second surgery was performed with the goal of pain relief. However, she reported her pain was significantly worse afterwards. She would receive weekly injections for pain relief that she reports would only marginally decrease her pain for about one week. She was also taking high doses of medication for nerve pain relief which she also reports provided marginal benefit. She had areas of heightened sensitivity on her legs where a bed sheet or even a gentle breeze would cause intense pain. Exposure to hot water would feel cold, and cold water would feel hot. She was unable to walk more than one block and remained in bed for over ten hours per day. She suffered extensive personal and professional quality of life losses at this time.\nLooking for relief, she tried medical yoga and received temporary relief. She also practiced traditional Tai Chi which provided minimal to no relief. She continued to have intense pain which had a significant impact on her quality of life and ability to perform daily tasks, including walking. In 2014, she tried a Qigong class and reported feeling that there was something very different about this class. Almost immediately, she felt a strong sense of relaxation that she had reportedly not found in many years. She was unable to attend many classes, so she purchased a video of the movements. Over the next year, she began to practice the exercises consistently until she could attend formal classes.\nSusan credits the practice of qigong with saving her life. She says it gave her a reason to get out of bed and socialize in the very early days of her practice. She is now able to walk with no limitations and her pain has improved by approximately 90%. Within three months of beginning qigong, she was able to stop all medications and injections she was receiving for pain relief. She continues to have some weakness in her arms and her hands, but it does not interfere with her ability to complete her daily activities. Despite her extensive cervical spine surgery, she reports full mobility in her shoulders and has nearly recovered full mobility in her neck. Her energy has also greatly improved and she routinely teaches three Qigong classes per week. In addition to this, she teaches at special events, including a Qigong class at a large yoga festival with over 1000 people in attendance. Recently, she started her first full time job in over six years.\nJames is a 70-year-old male. Over ten years ago, he was diagnosed with multi-level degenerative disc disease (DDD) in his lumbar spine, as well as severe central stenosis or narrowing of his spinal column around his spinal cord at L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1. In 2011, he had a CT scan and was told by his physician that it would not be long until he must rely on a wheelchair for all mobility. Surgery was presented as an option, but he was informed that the success rate was less than 10%.\nHe decided to forgo surgery and take his chances. Gradually, his legs became weaker and he would fall spontaneously. He worked as a salesman and as he was talking to clients, his legs would give out without warning and he would fall to the ground. To help his situation, he would park as close as he could to the entrance of stores or other destinations and would walk with carts or holding onto shelves or furniture. This would only help for so long before he would fall again.\nHe began looking for other options to help manage his condition. In 2012, he tried yoga. While it helped to temporarily control his pain, it had no effect on the weakness in his legs and he would continue to fall. One year later, at the suggestion of his wife, he tried a Qigong class. Due to his family’s personal schedules, he was unable to attend another class for two months. He decided to purchase a video of the movements he had learned and practiced them each day for 4–5 months until he was able to return to normal classes.\nSince participating in Qigong classes, he has not fallen even once, and has no reports of pain. He stated that “Qigong gave me my life back.” He has no other medical problems to mention and takes no medications. He revealed that the improvements he has experienced have gone far beyond what he expected. Where he used to fall often and without notice, he has not fallen since he began qigong and reports that he now even has a “spring to his step, and a spring in his heart.” Not too long ago, he sustained a left rotator cuff tear. After continuing to practice qigong, he had a full return of strength and movement with no pain or difficulty with his routine daily activities, all within six months.\nIn his professional life, he felt like he was burning out as an IT programmer but practicing qigong has reinvigorated him. He was able to complete many projects (some complex) that he never would have thought possible. He has since become certified to teach Qigong and tells anyone who will listen about his story. He has also witnessed many others gain significant benefit from the practice of Qigong and is thrilled that he gets to share this with others.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Patient with end stage renal disease from ADPKD', 'Referred for urgent renal replacement therapy', 'Complicated dialysis history with recurrent access thrombosis'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'No significant health problems prior to renal disease'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Thrombophilia screen', 'Finding': 'Presence of antiphospholipid antibodies'}, {'Test': 'Antinuclear antibody and anti ds-DNA antibodies', 'Finding': 'Negative'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS)', 'Type': 'Autoimmune', 'Location': 'Vascular access sites for dialysis'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Creation of left femoral graft', 'Details': 'Used after 4 weeks with extreme precautions'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Stable', 'DischargeStatus': 'Improved quality of life'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '1.5 years', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved hemoglobin levels and URR, free of infections and rigid catheters'}}}"
"We report a case of 24-year-old primigravida at 39-week period of gestation with severe kyphosis who was referred to our centre in second stage of labor with features of obstructed labor.\nThis patient was resident of remote hilly district who had history of physical assault at age of five years of life leading to vertebral fractures. She was managed with one month of bed rest and then she was mobilized without any support. She regained functional mobility but developed a hunchback.\nAt ten years of age, she developed fever, hemoptysis, swelling over back with pus like discharge, and weight loss for which she was admitted in another centre for one month and was diagnosed as a case of Pott's spine and treated with antitubercular drugs. She did not receive any formal education and used to do all household chores with no restriction in daily activities. She was married at the age of 20 years and conceived spontaneously. She became aware of pregnancy after she felt quickening at four months of gestation and went to the nearest primary health centre which was at a distance of two hours from her home on foot. She was advised to visit a better centre for risk assessment and safe confinement of pregnancy but due to monetary problem she decided to go only after term. She presented to the primary health centre at 39 weeks after one day of labor pain and leaking per vaginum for 48 hours, at around 12 pm midday where she was found to be fully dilated and was immediately referred. She arrived at our facility at 12 midnight and when examined, she was of short stature with height of 4 feet and thin built weighing 33 kgs. Her back was severely kyphotic with large gibbus in the lumbosacral region and multiple healed sinus in the back (Figures and ). She was exhausted due to prolonged labor and her blood pressure was 150/100 mm of hg. The anterior abdominal wall was markedly protuberant and the axis of the term size uterus showed corresponding anterior angulation. The presentation of the fetus was cephalic with right occiput transverse position and the cardiotocograph was reassuring. Her per vaginum findings were consistent with those of kyphotic pelvis with features of obstructed labor with flat sacrum, narrow outlet, and subpubic angle, the station of the head was −2, there was a large caput succedaneum and moulding, and the liquor was meconium stained. The patient was dyspneic and occasional crepitations could be auscultated in bilateral lung fields and normal cardiac auscultation. Since the patient presented in advanced labor pulmonary function, tests could not be done prior to delivery. As vaginal delivery was not possible, she was immediately taken up for emergency caesarean section. Since the deformity was present in the lumbosacral region with no previous evaluation, spinal anesthesia was not contemplated. General anesthesia was given by using rapid sequence induction with propofol. Caesarean section was done by giving paramedian skin incision. Lower segment uterine incision was used and baby was delivered by reverse breech extraction. It was a 3.7 kg male baby, vigorous at birth, but was admitted in nursery for observation for meconium aspiration syndrome. There was atonic postpartum hemorrhage which was managed with uterine massage, uterotonics, and bilateral uterine artery ligation. Intraoperatively, one pint of blood was transfused. Keeping in view the risk to the health of the patient in subsequent pregnancy, even option of tubal ligation was discussed with the patient and her husband prior to caesarean but they refused to give consent for ligation. Intraoperatively, bladder was found to be edematous and pulled up so catheterization was done for 14 days. Postoperative period was uneventful. Blood pressure normalized after delivery and patient was able to ambulate from second postoperative day. Postoperative hemoglobin was 9.4 mg/dL. Baby was shifted out from nursery on second day and breastfeeding was initiated. Suture was removed on tenth day and wound healing was good. X-ray done after delivery showed reversal of normal curvature of spine with lordosis in thoracic region and kyphosis in lumbar region (). Pulmonary function test showed mild restrictive pattern. Patient was discharged on persistent request on 10th postoperative day with catheter in situ and she was advised to follow up at the primary health centre as she cited inability to commute to our centre.","{

"A 24-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 3, para 0) with a 6-year history of septate uterus presented to the emergency room with premature rupture of the membranes and the threat of premature labor for 9 hours. In her personal medical history, she had used misoprostol for medical abortion 6 and 3 years previously. There was no history of smoking, alcoholic beverage consumption, or drug abuse during the pregnancy, and no hereditary anomalies were identified in her family.\nA male neonate who weighed 2400 g was born at 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation by cesarean section. His Apgar scores were 10 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. At birth, we noticed an amniotic band that consisted of a layer of annular amniotic tissue approximately 1 cm wide, which was tightened around the upper third of the right upper limb. The distal limb displayed cyanoderma, edema of the extremity, and focal peeling, with no autonomous activities or reactions of tenderness (). An X-ray showed a negative result for the humerus, but clear swelling of the soft tissues (). During the operation, the space between the amniotic band and upper limb skin was carefully separated and the band was cut off directly. The neonate was then transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. Four hours later, swelling of the right limb was further aggravated, the radial artery could not be reached, and the local skin color did not improve. Hypoperfusion of the limb was continued and the limb remained insensate without motor compromise (). We considered the possibility that further necrosis of the limb and local toxin absorption could lead to death of the neonate. We decided to amputate the upper third of the right upper extremity. The patient was relatively stable during anesthesia and successfully underwent surgery (). No severe complications occurred after the operation. The incision was almost healed without infection, dehiscence, or other complications, as observed by postoperative X-ray images (). The neonate recovered rapidly and was discharged 9 days after surgery. The stitches were removed 14 days after surgery. The patient was followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months post-surgery, with no complaints of pain or clinical evidence of infection or further limb necrosis.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Routine checkup blood test showed slightly elevated liver enzymes'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Right adrenal lesion of 9 cm in diameter'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal MRI', 'Finding': 'Soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm originating from right adrenal gland'}, {'Test': 'Adrenal scan', 'Finding': 'Well encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with necrosis and calcifications'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Benign schwannoma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Right adrenal gland'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy', 'Details': 'Converted to open surgery due to tumor adherence to IVC and renal vein'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on sixth day post-surgery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'N/A', 'FunctionalStatus': 'N/A'}}}"
"The index patient was a 34-year old female referred to the bariatric clinic by the general practitioner on her own request to treat her morbid obesity. She was born with a normal birth weight but large head circumference for which she never had a diagnostic analysis. At the age of five, her body weight was already significantly higher compared to her peers. No specific life events could explain her obesity. Cognitive development was normal and she followed normal education. She underwent treatment for recurrent nasal polyps. Her mother also had a large head size and suffered from morbid obesity as well. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and died from a pulmonary embolism after placement of an Adjustable Gastric Band. A maternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 and the maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at young age. The younger sister of the index patient was overweight and was reported to also have a large head size (Figure ).\nSince childhood, the index patient followed several different coaching programs to change her eating behavior and exercise pattern to induce weight loss. She lost weight several times but was never able to maintain her weight loss. At the time of the intake procedure at the bariatric clinic, her height was 1.69 m (SD −0.2) and weight 164 kg (SD +6.8), resulting in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 57.6 kg/m2 and a predominant abdominal obesity. Head size was not measured at that time since this is not part of bariatric screening procedures. Biochemical analysis of the blood revealed no abnormalities, and excluded endocrine hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism. The fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM.\nThe combination of early onset morbid obesity resulted in suspicion of a genetic cause of her obesity. She was offered diagnostic genetic analysis of 52 obesity–associated genes to identify a possible underlying genetic obesity cause.\nThe patient was eligible for bariatric surgery and underwent a sleeve gastrectomy without complications (performed in 2014 using a standardized fashion). At 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery, she achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss of 39.4, 48.8 and 44.9, respectively. This resulted in a current BMI of 30.1 kg/m2. This was within the range of the results which were observed in a control group of 18 female patients, with a negative obesity genetic test result. These female patients were matched for age and BMI and achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss (TBWL) of 30.3 after 1 year, 31 after 2 years and 30 after 3 years of follow-up.\nA few months after surgery, the result of the obesity gene panel analysis was returned and showed heterozygosity for a known pathogenic mutation in the PTEN gene (): c.202T>C p.(Tyr68His). This mutation has been described previously in patients with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PTEN HTS) (Marsh et al., ). No other pathogenic mutations were shown in the remaining 50 obesity–associated genes (Table ). At the genetic clinic, a head circumference of 63 cm (+5SD) and pedigree analysis (family history of multiple tumors) further supported the molecular diagnosis of PTEN HTS.\nAccording to the PTEN HTS guidelines, patients with pathogenic PTEN mutations are advised to visit the outpatient clinic for familial tumors, for lifelong surveillance of tumors that are associated with the PTEN mutations (Dutch Guidelines, ; Eng, ). Our patient underwent additional biochemical laboratory- and ultrasound screening to exclude thyroid gland carcinoma. Besides a few benign nodules on the ultrasound, no abnormalities could be determined. A yearly follow-up ultrasound of her thyroid gland and yearly serum thyroid stimulating hormone analysis was advised. Screening for breast, endometrium and colorectal cancer, also revealed no anomalies.","{

"A 25-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic with a complaint of recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek of three-month duration. He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region. We suspected the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. A periapical view was then taken with gutta-percha inserted into the sinus for foreign body localization purpose. The radiograph revealed the gutta-percha pointed towards the site of titanium plate and screws placed used for rigid fixation, and with the molar orthodontic tube appliance in its vicinity (). A cone beam CT was performed to provide a 3D detailed location of the appliance (Figures and ) and confirmed it to be located outside the maxillary antrum.\nThe presence of the molar orthodontic tube foreign body reaction was suspected as the most probable cause of the recurrent right cheek pain and swelling associated with an intraoral discharging sinus. Exploration of the site was performed through the sulcular incision under general anesthesia. The dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap. It was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. Just below it, one titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was inspected and found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone. However, a decision was made to remove them based on the fact that they are present in an infected area. (). The Le Fort I osteotomy site showed good healing with new bone formation. Patient had an uneventful recovery thereafter, and the orthognathic surgical team who attended him previously was informed of his progress.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Creation of hemodialysis access', 'Complaints of numbness and mild pain in left hand post AVF creation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Diagnosis': ""ESRD due to Diabetic nephropathy, Charcot's disease of left lower extremity, amputation below knee of left lower extremity""}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Duplex Doppler Ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Good flow in AVF with partial reversal of flow in proximal left ulnar artery'}, {'Test': 'EMG', 'Finding': 'Moderate to severe axonal neuropathy in bilateral upper extremities'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Entrapment of median nerve and cubital tunnel syndrome in left upper extremity'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Nerve compression syndrome', 'Type': 'Compression neuropathy', 'Location': 'Left upper arm, cubital tunnel, carpal tunnel'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Exploration and neurolysis of median nerve, cubital tunnel release, carpal tunnel release, ulnar release, AVF superficialization', 'Details': 'Surgical decompression and release of affected nerves'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Improvement in pain and muscle weakness', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Significant improvement in pain and weakness'}}}"
"A 40 year old woman was admitted to the obstetrics ward during the 25th week of gestation to adjust her anticoagulation regimen. She was gravida 2, with one previous miscarriage and had a metallic mitral valve prosthesis as a result of a childhood episode of rheumatic fever. Except for her cardiac disease, which was under control, she led a normal life and was employed as a social worker. This woman discovered that she was pregnant in the first trimester of gestation, and without consulting her physician, stopped using her anticoagulants. She was late in initiating antenatal care and consequently her referral to a specialized antenatal clinic was also delayed. When she was in the 25th week of gestation, she reached the third level of care and was admitted to the obstetrics ward where she was prescribed 10,000 units of unfractionated heparin twice a day. During her third night in the hospital, after receiving subcutaneous heparin for almost 72 hours (at that time the dose had been increased to 12,000 units twice a day), she developed headache, nausea, vomiting and mental confusion. At that time, physical examination revealed a stiff neck, but no focal neurological deficits were noted. The patient's pupils showed isocoria and were reactive to light, and she had a Glasgow coma score of 11. During this initial phase of hospitalization, her blood pressure and pulse remained within the normal range. APTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time) was 57 seconds. A computerized tomography scan displayed an intraparenchymatous haematoma with bloody obliteration of the ventricles. The patient underwent neurosurgical drainage of this lesion and was admitted to the obstetrical intensive care unit, where postoperative care and ventilatory support was continued. During the following hours, her neurological status deteriorated progressively and on the following day, the patient appeared to have gone into a non-reactive coma with no sign of brainstem activity. Maternal brain death was confirmed by a transcranial Doppler scan of the cerebral arteries. At that time, foetal weight was estimated at 660 g according to ultrasound evaluation. After the diagnosis of brain death, the situation was explained to the woman's family, who informed the medical team that the deceased woman had legally registered her desire to posthumously donate her organs. In view of the deceased woman's wishes and the status of the foetus, a conservative approach was adopted by the medical team, and the necessary measures to prolong maternal homeostasis were implemented.\nWe assumed that brain death would have resulted in a condition of panhypopituitarism caused by loss of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis function. Accordingly, enteral replacement of thyroid hormone and cortisol (prednisone) was carried out. The patient also developed a persistent state of hyperglycemia that was treated with continuous intravenous insulin. Diabetes Insipidus was treated with enteric desmopressin (DDAVP), and diuresis and serum sodium were used to titrate the dose of DDAVP.\nThe patient developed mild hypotension, which was initially treated with crystalloid and colloid replacement to maintain central venous pressure between 14 and 18 centimetres of water, plus low doses of norepinephrine. A moderate but persistent bradycardia was initially treated with dopamine and later with low doses of epinephrine. Pressure-limited mechanical ventilation was used to manage mild respiratory alkalosis (CO2 = 32 mmHg) and an arterial oxygen saturation greater than 94%.\nBasal energy expenditure (BEE) was calculated using the Harris-Benedict formula (BEE = 655 + [9.6 × weight(kg)] + [1.8 × height(cm)] - [4.7 × age(yr)]), multiplied by 1.25 (stress factor for pregnancy), adding 300 Kcal for a single foetus and deducting 15% from the BEE to compensate for the reduction in metabolism associated with the state of brain death []. Enteral nutrition was used to provide the total daily calorie requirement.\nHypothermia was a major feature during this period and was treated with passive heating using an air heater and blankets to maintain temperature > 36°C. After ten days of somatic support, the patient developed ventilation-associated pneumonia, which was treated with ceftriaxone, and a tracheotomy was performed to facilitate bronchial hygiene and mechanical ventilation.\nFoetal well-being was thoroughly evaluated by electronic foetal heart rate monitoring, foetal Doppler velocimetry and biophysical profile. Betamethasone was used to accelerate foetal lung maturity. During a total of twenty-five days of prolongation, the maternal organism remained mostly stable. Nevertheless, in the last week of prolongation progressive oligohydramnios was detected in the foetus and a Doppler test revealed centralization (brain sparring). Foetal status helped in reaching the decision to perform a Caesarean section at that moment. It is possible that, even at the low doses used, the vasoconstrictors may have contributed to the functional placental insufficiency by constricting the uterine vessels, resulting in placental hypoperfusion. A male infant was born weighting 815 g, with an Apgar score of 9 and 10 in the first and fifth minutes, respectively. Following delivery, the premature newborn was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. He required no mechanical ventilation and had no major complications. Some hours after delivery, the maternal organs were removed for donation. The baby was discharged from hospital weighing 1850 g at 40 days of life. Re-evaluation of the infant during a follow-up visit at 90 days of life revealed normal development and no detectable sequelae.","{

"A 26-year-old healthy woman had developed papules and nodules on the right arm 6 months ago. Despite treatment with short course systemic antibiotics the lesions had enlarged and gradually extended to the forearm and hand and also to her fingers. She was referred to us for the evaluation of the eruption. The patient was not febrile and denied having been scratched by any cat. She had had no previous illness nor received any immunosuppressive drugs. On physical examination, multiple tender erythematous angiomatous papules and nodules in a grouped pattern were seen on the extensor aspect of the right arm that extended to the distal part in varying sizes of 1 to 2 cm in diameter []. The remainder of her skin was essentially normal, with no signs of a blistering or erythematous background. There was revealed painful axillary lymphadenopathy on general examination. There was no sign of a mucous membrane lesion or hepatosplenomegaly. It became evident that she also suffers from severe pruritus and occasionally bleeding in the papules. Routine laboratory blood tests, CD4 count were normal. ELISA tests for HIV were negative. No evidence of other immunosuppressive status was revealed by various systemic examinations. Histopathological examination showed an epidermal collaret with mild hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis and crust formation. In the dermis, proliferation of blood vessels and inflammatory cells were seen. The vascular component in the upper dermis was constituted by thin-walled vessels lined by plump, and deeper are small and thick-walled vessels []. The inflammatory cells were composed of lymphocytes and some eosinophils and neutrophils. In some areas eosinophilic granular material was present. The silver stain revealed a small number of bacilli like organisms []; we diagnosed the patient's eruption as BA. A cutaneous lesion did not respond within 4 weeks of adequate oral erythromycin, so the patient was treated with oral clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (second- line of treatment) and in order to control the sever with pruritus doxepin 25 mg once daily which resulted in significant improvement over a 3 month treatment period []. The patient is now, 3 months after treatment, living her normal life without experiencing any problems or showing any signs of the recurrence of the disease.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Abdominal pain in right upper quadrant', 'Cutaneous lesion with white, purulent discharge in the same region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Liver abscess removal of unknown etiology fifteen years ago'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal ultrasonography', 'Finding': '6 cm cystic mass with calcified membrane and comet-tail artifact, highly suggestive of a fistula in segments 7 and 8'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal CT-scan with contrast', 'Finding': 'Single, calcified, membranous lesion in segments 8 and 4A with a fistula to the abdominal anterior wall, subcutaneous density within the cyst'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Fistulizing cystic lesion in the abdomen', 'Type': 'Infection', 'Location': 'Segments 8 and 4A'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgical drainage by subcostal incision under local anesthesia', 'Details': ""Approximately 100 mL of purulent material drained, no excision due to patient's advanced age""}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Admitted to ICU for bradycardia and hypoglycemia, treated with antibiotics', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged after 7 days'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No recurrence of cyst on ultrasound imaging'}}}"
"A 57-year-old male Han Chinese patient was admitted to our hospital in September 2018 due to neck discomfort. Physical examination on admission showed a local bulge on the right side of the neck, while the trachea was shifted to the left. Clinical examination revealed a large lump on the right lobe of the thyroid gland, which was approximately 5 × 4 cm in size. His previous medical history showed that he was admitted to the hospital in June 2007 due to painless hematuria and was diagnosed with right renal carcinoma. He then underwent radical resection of the right renal carcinoma. Postoperative pathological examination showed a moderately differentiated right ccRCC (stage III), and the patient did not receive further treatment after the operation. The re-examination of kidneys was done every year through ultrasound, which showed no abnormal echo in the right renal fossa. Ultrasound examination in July 2012 in our hospital showed the presence of multiple thyroid nodules, and the size of the largest nodule was about 1.2 × 0.6 cm, which was present in the right lobe with a clear boundary and homogenous echo. The patient refused the treatment because he was asymptomatic. Color ultrasound examination of thyroid in March 2015 revealed that the size of the largest nodule with clear boundary in the right lobe was about 2.5 × 1.3 cm, but the echo was heterogeneous, and small patchy fluid sonolucent area was found in the lesion. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) showed circular blood flow signals around the nodule and poor blood flow signals inside the nodule (Fig. ). So, re-examination by ultrasound was suggested due to his previous medical history. The results of the ultrasound examination conducted in September 2018 showed an evident increase in the volume of the right thyroid lobe, and the shape of the right lobe also remained abnormal. The thickness of the right lobe was 4.6 cm. Multiple hypoechoic nodules were detected in the thyroid gland, and the size of the largest nodule was about 5.6 × 3.7 cm (in the right lobe, and was merged with several nodules), in which the boundary was unclear, and the internal echo remained heterogeneous. In addition, dotty calcification and irregular fluid sonolucent area were also found. The results of CDFI showed relatively rich blood flow signals inside and around the nodule (Fig. ). CT showed an oval lesion with slightly lower density in the right lobe of the thyroid, and the area of the maximum cross-section was about 5.1 cm × 4.3 cm. The density inside the lesion was slightly uneven, with a mean CT value of about 30 Hu, and multiple sand-like calcifications were found (Fig. ). Laboratory examinations revealed serum free tri-iodothyronine (T3) of 5.45 pmol/l, serum-free tetraiodothyronine (T4) of 7.72 pmol/l, serum thyrotropin (TSH) of 1.01 uIU/ml, thyroglobulin antibody (TGA) of 0.00 IU/ml, thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOA) of 0.70 IU/ml and parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 23.50 pg/ml.\nAs thyroid metastasis from ccRCC is very rare, and the patient had a long history of a thyroid nodule, thyroid metastasis was not considered, and so the patient was initially diagnosed with nodular goiter. The patient chose surgical resection and refused a preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) examination to confirm the pathology. Bilateral partial thyroidectomy under general anesthesia was conducted. Intraoperative frozen pathological examination showed clear cell carcinoma in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, which was surrounded by benign thyroid tumors and accompanied by borderline tumors in the left lobe. Therefore, total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection in the central neck area was conducted. The postoperative pathological examination showed clear cell carcinoma in the right thyroid tissue (tumor size: 4 × 3. 5 × 3.5 cm), and nodular goiter accompanied with non-typical follicular adenoma around the clear cell carcinoma and no metastasis in one of the lymph nodes in the central neck area of the left lobe. Immunohistochemistry revealed CKAE1/AE3 (+); Vimentin (+); CD10 (+); CK8/18 (partially +); CK7 (-); CK19 (-); Galectin-3 (-); CD117 (-); RCC (-); TG (-); CT (-); PTH (-); P53 (+), and S of 8%; and Ki-67 (+) and S of 15% (Fig. ). According to immunohistochemistry findings and previous medical histories, the patient was confirmed with the diagnosis of thyroid metastasis from ccRCC. The patient recovered well from the operation and was advised to receive targeted therapy in the Oncology Department. However, the patient refused further treatment considering financial issues. The patient was followed up for 2 years and had not developed any additional metastasis. This case report was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zibo Central Hospital and the patients informed written consent.","{

"A 19-year-old female was treated in our clinic in 2012 because of an ACL rupture. She had twisted and injured her knee in the guard position during a judo match. Preoperative physical examination revealed a Lachman test score of 3+ and a KneeLax examination, in which a 132 N force was applied, showed a 10-mm slippage of the affected knee compared with the unaffected one. The diagnosis of ACL tear was confirmed using MRI. The patient underwent arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle reconstruction using hamstring tendons in a surgical procedure that was the same as that described in case 1.\nPostoperative CT revealed that the distance between the TR button and the exit of the tunnel on the lateral femoral cortex was 0 mm for the AM bundle and 0.5 mm for the PL bundle (). She undertook routine rehabilitation. At six months after the operation, she felt a slight lateral knee pain on the TR button of the PL bundle. However, she was able to carry out her routine rehabilitation schedule and return to playing judo. One year after the surgery, she could play judo and participate in competitions, but the lateral pain did not disappear and a slight swelling occurred on the lateral side of the knee. The lateral pain was not dependent on the knee flexion angle. She wanted to remove the TR buttons at the time of the second arthroscopy. TR buttons of both AM and PL bundles were removed; that of the PL bundle was just beneath the ITB. In addition, the adjustable loop in the TR of the PL bundle had partially worn out, and therefore was easily removed. A second arthroscopic evaluation of the graft indicated that the reconstructed ACL had good synovial coverage and rigid tensioning and the graft had been incorporated into the femoral bone tunnel. After removal of the TR button, graft tensioning and incorporation did not change and the lateral knee pain immediately disappeared. Therefore, we considered that the lateral pain was related to irritation between the TR button of the PL bundle and the ITB as in cases 1 and 2. The patient could finally return to performing judo.\nThis study had Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent was obtained from the patients.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Intractable postprandial abdominal pain', 'Bloody vomiting'], 'MedicalHistory': {'History': 'Intermittent abdominal pain for the last six months', 'MedicalBackground': 'Recurrent epigastric pain, irregular use of proton pump inhibitors'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Upper GIS endoscopy', 'Finding': 'Submucosally located mass lesion at the antrum-corpus junction on the greater gastric curvature'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal CT scan', 'Finding': 'Smooth contoured mass lesion of 52 × 25 × 32 mm containing focal calcifications on the greater gastric curvature'}, {'Test': 'PET scan', 'Finding': 'Smooth contoured mass of 5 × 5 cm with scattered calcifications in the gastric corpus'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Gastric cavernous hemangioma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Greater gastric curvature'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Wedge resection', 'Details': 'Resection of the mass from the greater gastric curvature'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'No complications', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on the seventh postoperative day'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'N/A', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Not specified'}}}"
"A 12-year-old boy presented to the oral and maxillofacial surgery department of our institution with swelling in lower jaw since 6 months, which progressively increased in size and was painful. It was diagnosed to be dentigerous cyst that required excision due to its painful symptomatology. He was an established case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy since childhood and was confined to wheel chair since then. The child had no history of recent upper respiratory tract infection or previous anesthetic exposures. On physical examination, the weight of the child was measured to be 48 kg and he had wasting of muscles in both the lower limbs with motor power of grade II. Airway examination revealed mouth opening of >3 cm with modified Mallampati grade of II, normal thyromental and mento-hyoid distance and normal range of neck movements []. Examination of the back revealed a mild scoliosis involving the thoraco-lumbar region with convexity toward the right side. Cardiovascular and respiratory system examination was unremarkable. The laboratory investigations were all within normal limits except for raised creatine kinase levels of 1823 IU/L (normal 75–230). The electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and biventricular hypertrophy and findings of echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 32% with moderate depression of the left ventricular systolic function. The child was planned for excision of dentigerous cyst. During the preoperative visit, the child and the parents were highly anxious about the procedure but after careful counseling and discussion of various implications and the risks associated with general anesthesia, the parents and the child agreed to undergo the procedure under procedural sedation. The child was given nil per oral instructions according to the standard protocol and was advised tab. ranitidine 150 mg PO and tab. metoclopramide 10 mg PO in the night and in the morning 2 h before the planned procedure. On the day of procedure, the anesthesia machine was properly checked and flushed to remove any traces of inhalational agents and all vaporizers were removed. The child was shifted to the operating room and an intravenous line was secured and preloading done with 400 mL of the normal saline solution. The monitoring included five lead electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) and pulse oximetry. The child was then premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenously (IV) and fentanyl 1 μg/kg was given IV to achieve analgesia. Dexmedetomidine was administered slowly with a loading dose of 1 μg/kg over 15 min followed by a continuous infusion at 0.5 μg/kg/h throughout the surgical procedure. Lignocaine with 1 in 2 lakh adrenaline was used for local infiltration and the child was given supplemental oxygen through nasal prongs at 3 L/min. The child remained calm and comfortable throughout the procedure which lasted for 40 min and did not complain of any pain. At the end of procedure, the dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued and the child remained sedated but arousable to verbal commands. Postoperatively, the child was observed in a high dependency unit for 2 h. The recovery period was uneventful and the child was discharged after 6 h when fully awake and responding.","{

"A 29-year-old male patient came to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden onset of right upper quadrant pain, which was associated with nausea and vomiting. On history the patient reported some chronic pain in the right upper quadrant, which had been present in the previous days, which suddenly had become worse prior to admission to the hospital. Past medical history was completely unremarkable. On clinical examination the patient appeared pale and in distress. Blood pressure was 80/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 120, and respiratory rate was 40. The abdomen was painful with guarding and rebound in all four quadrants. Laboratory tests showed Hb of 69 g/dL and WBC 15.000 μL. A FAST ultrasound performed in emergency showed an eight by five cm lesion in segments V and VI of the liver, with diffuse hemoperitoneum. An emergency abdominal CT scan was requested, and it showed evidence of an eight by five cm ruptured hepatic lesion with massive hemoperitoneum and leakage of contrast medium. The lesion had a big extrahepatic component with possible invasion of the hepatoduodenal ligament and gallbladder (). While the CT scan was being performed the patient became clinically unstable, and therefore decision was taken to bring the patient to the operating room for an emergency surgery. In the operating room, a Chevron incision was performed to gain access into the abdomen. Packing of the liver together with a Pringle maneuver was performed to achieve hepatic inflow occlusion and slow down the bleeding. After aspiration of three liters of blood that had been accumulating in the abdominal cavity we proceeded to a thorough inspection of the bleeding mass in the liver. The mass was invading the hepatoduodenal ligament, and it was extending into but not penetrating the second part of the duodenum (). No other visible masses were seen in the liver or in the peritoneal cavity. Resection of segments V and VI of the liver en bloc with the gallbladder was performed using LigaSure device (Figures and ). The patient was then transferred to ICU. He made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on POD 10. Pathology confirmed the suspicion that the mass was a ruptured fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. Follow-up CT scans after 6 months showed recurrence of the disease in the liver bilaterally and peritoneal metastases, which were treated with chemotherapy. The patient died 26 months after the surgery.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Large ulcerated nodule in the left cheek extending to the left neck region', 'Recurrence of squamous cell skin cancer lesion previously excised from left mandibular region'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Previous squamous cell skin cancer lesion excised with clear margins'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Tissue Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Confirmed tumor recurrence'}, {'Test': 'CT-scan of head and neck region', 'Finding': 'Extensive soft tissue invasion of the tumor'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Squamous cell skin cancer recurrence', 'Type': 'Malignant tumor', 'Location': 'Left cheek and neck region'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Cetuximab chemotherapy', 'Details': 'Administered at a dose of 400 mg/m2 every 15 days for 6 months'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complete regression of tumor lesion', 'DischargeStatus': 'Terminated treatment after 6 months'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '12 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient in complete clinical remission'}}}"
"A 49 year old gentleman presented to cardiology with lower limb claudication pain and breathlessness of three years duration. Clinical examination revealed upper limb hypertension, with similar blood pressures in both arms (180/100 mm Hg). His past history included repair of coarctation of aorta about 30 years ago. The medical records and operative details from the previous operation were unavailable. The operation had been performed through a left thoracotomy. An MRI scan revealed a 2 cm long narrowing of the aorta just distal to the origin of an aberrant right subclavian artery, which was the last of four branches from the aortic arch (Fig. ). The origins of the arch vessels did not show any sign of narrowing. The aortic root and ascending aorta were 3.5 cm in diameter, and the arch was of normal calibre. The diameter in the region of the stenosis was 1.4 cm with an additional web-like stenotic lesion at the distal end of the stenotic segment. There was evidence of calcification, possibly of an interposition tube graft which had been used at the time of the first operation. The descending thoracic aorta was of normal calibre.\nIn view of his symptomatic status, a re-intervention was considered appropriate. In view of his previous surgery, and especially the fact that the area of re-coarctation appeared to be calcified, it was decided to approach the aorta via a median sternotomy and construct an extra-anatomic ascending to descending thoracic aorta bypass graft. Cardiopulmonary bypass would be necessary to lift the heart out of the way to gain access to the descending thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm. We planned to use an apical suction device to keep the empty beating heart elevated.\nThe sternotomy was completed uneventfully. The pericardial cavity was obliterated with dense adhesions. This was rather surprising since we had anticipated that the previous procedure would have been extra-pericardial. However, further dissection revealed a large hole in the pericardial sac with the left lung directly adherent to the heart. The adhesions were released, some of them after establishing cardiopulmonary bypass using ascending aortic cannulation for inflow and bicaval cannulation (to maintain adequate venous drainage even after lifting up the heart) for venous outflow. Once the apex and the posterior surface of the heart were free of adhesions, an apical suction device (URCHIN™ Heart Positioner, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis MN55432-5604 USA) was placed in position and the beating heart was lifted superiorly. This allowed further dissection in the posterior pericardium and allowing freeing up of adhesions between the left lung and the descending thoracic aorta, and allowed visualization of and access to the descending thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm in spite of a deep thoracic cavity (Fig. ). Proximal and distal cross clamps were applied isolating a 4 cm length of aorta. A longitudinal incision was made in this segment and an 18 mm Haemashield Platinum™ Woven Double Velour Vascular tube graft (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA 01760-1537) was anastomosed in an end to side manner using continuous 3-0 polypropylene sutures. The clamps were released, the distal one first, the aorta was de-aired and the anastomosis was checked. The graft was then routed to the right of the inferior vena cava and brought up alongside the right atrium to the ascending aorta. The apical suction device was released and the heart was replaced in the pericardial sac. The length of the tube graft was estimated after filling up the heart. A side biting clamp was applied to the ascending aorta and the proximal anastomosis of the tube graft was constructed to a longitudinal arteriotomy using 3-0 polypropylene sutures. The clamp was released, the graft was de-aired, and the anastomosis checked. The patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass with no inotropic support. Haemostasis was ensured and the chest was closed in the routine manner leaving two drains in the left pleural space, one drain in the pericardial sac and one in the mediastinum.\nThe patient was extubated eight hours after arrival in the intensive care unit. His drains were removed the next morning. He made an uneventful recovery thereafter except for needing some respiratory support with non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure for treating basal atelectasis. A CT scan was done prior to his discharge from hospital on the tenth postoperative day. Figure shows an oblique 3-D reconstructed view from the CT scan demonstrating the locations of the proximal and distal anastomoses, and the lie of the graft. The patient was reviewed in outpatients six weeks after his discharge. His claudication pain had disappeared completely. His upper limb blood pressure was 120/60 mm Hg on a reduced amount of medication.","{

"A 49-year-old female experiencing untreated hypertension for several years presented with severe chest and back pain. A CT scan was performed and revealed an aortic dissection (Stanford type B) and an intimal flap was noted immediately distal from the origin of the left subclavian artery. After 4 days of medical management, her urine output decreased and both femoral pulses were weakened. Another CT scan was performed, showing that the aortic dissection had worsened and there was nearly total occlusion of the mid-aorta (). We recommended aortic repair operation, which the patient and her family refused. TEVAR was recommended as another treatment option to cover the intimal flap of the dissection. To acquire the proper proximal landing zone, her left subclavian artery and two thirds of the origin of the left common carotid artery would be covered by the stent graft. For the occluded left subclavian artery, revascularization can then be selectively considered in a staged approach if left arm pain, claudication and subclavian steal syndrome develop. The modified chimney technique was planned to preserve the blood flow of the left common carotid artery. The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and a left femoral arteriotomy was performed under general anesthesia. The 035 inch wire was placed in the ascending aorta and the left subclavian artery through the left radial artery approach. This wire is important to rescue the left carotid artery flow. If an aortic stent graft totally covers the left carotid artery or if it is difficult to select the left carotid artery with a catheter, then we can perform emergency balloon dilatation and place a chimney graft stent from the left subclavian artery to the aorta via this wire. The deployment of a 38×150 mm SEAL aortic stent graft (S&G Biotech, Seongnam, Korea) was performed so that the proximal part of the stent graft covered two thirds of the ostium of the left common carotid artery. After selection of the left common carotid artery using a 5 Fr Judkin right catheter (Cordis, Hialeah, FL, USA) through the gap between the stent graft and the left carotid artery, we passed a 035 inch Terumo wire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) into the left carotid artery through the right femoral artery and exchanged it with an Amplatz stiff wire. Then, an 8×60 mm SMART nitinol stent (Cordis, Hialeah, FL, USA) was deployed into the left common carotid artery. A final angiogram showed excellent results with good flow to both the thoracic aorta and the left common carotid artery. No endoleak was noted (). The occluded true lumen was re-expanded and the false lumen was not seen. The mean pressure gradient between the thoracic and abdominal aorta was decreased to 20 mm Hg from 90 mm Hg immediately after TEVAR (). After 18 months there has been no endoleak, restenosis of the stent in the left carotid artery or other complications.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Sporadic generalized epileptic seizures', 'Reactive depressive syndrome'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousHistory': 'Depressive-apathetic episodes during adolescence and early adulthood, generalized seizures, attention and memory deficits'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'EEG', 'Finding': 'Widespread slow wave activity, epileptic activity during autoscopic experiences'}, {'Test': 'MRI', 'Finding': 'Integrity of white matter tracts, no alteration in temporo-parietal junction'}, {'Test': 'SPECT', 'Finding': 'Cerebral hypometabolism in parietal and occipital lobes'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'He-autoscopic seizures', 'Type': 'Epileptic disorder', 'Location': 'Cerebral cortex'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Levetiracetam', 'Details': '3000 mg/day dosage'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Resolution of he-autoscopic seizures'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '2 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No seizure recurrence, but severe depressive symptoms persist'}}}"
"A 32-year-old healthy pregnant woman with more than 30 gestational weeks was admitted to the hospital due to the fetal cardiac mass. The fetal echocardiography showed a heterogeneous lesion of 2.85 cm × 2.25 cm on the right side of the heart, which compressed the tricuspid annulus by 50% with pericardial effusion []. It was difficult to distinguish the source of fetal cardiac mass either within the heart or in the pericardial cavity by fetal echocardiography. The fetus was at risk when the fetal heart rate decreased to less than 80 bpm and pericardial effusion continued to increase during the hospitalization. The EXIT procedure was performed to resect fetal cardiac tumor if it was located in the pericardial cavity or to ameliorate cardiac compression and bradycardia by pericardial effusion drainage.\nThe cesarean section was performed, and the uterine relaxation was attained with the inhalation of a high dose of sevoflurane (5–10%). The fetus was released from the uterus, and the placental circulation was kept intact. The fetal heart was exposed through the median sternotomy. The mass was located within the right atrium and hence could not be quickly removed without cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, about 30 ml of pericardial effusion was drained, and the skin was just sutured without closing the sternum to release the space for the cardiac mass. The tricuspid annulus compression was ameliorated as demonstrated by fetal echocardiography []. The fetus delivered weighed 2.2 kg and had a sinus rhythm of 130–150 bpm. The cesarean section was completed with the administration of oxytocin and termination of sevoflurane inhalation after fetal delivery. The pregnant woman recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the 5th day postoperatively.\nThe neonate was intubated with mechanical respiratory support, and his heart function was still impaired by the cardiac mass compression. Dopamine was administered at a rate of 10 μg·kg−1·min−1 to maintain the mean blood pressure ranging from 40 to 50 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). Therefore, cardiac tumor resection was performed under the cardiopulmonary bypass on the 2nd day after birth []. The pathological examination demonstrated the diagnosis of cardiac hemangioma. The neonate recovered well and was discharged after 1 month with 2.75 kg weight. No evidence of cardiac tumor recurrence was reported after a follow-up of 10 months.","{

"The patient was a 45-year-old male having visited our department with a complaint of right facial swelling in 2007. He felt a ‘shock’ at the right cheek as if hit by something hard while operating a construction vehicle. Bleeding from the skin of the right cheek was observed but stopped after a few minutes of applying pressure to the site. In a few days, swelling developed on the right side of his face accompanied by a slight trismus. He visited a dental office and was prescribed antibiotics and referred to our department. The patient was well-built, and the right side of his face was diffusely swollen. The wound at the site of penetration was not remarkable. Panorama and posteroanterior X-ray examination revealed a small radiopaque foreign body at the lateral aspect of the right mandibular ramus. CT examination indicated that the foreign body was located under the masseter muscle. The foreign body was not palpable from the surface of the face or the oral mucosa. With the diagnosis of a foreign body on the right side of his face, the removal was planned after receiving medications for symptom improvement. However, the patient did not return to the hospital or for a follow-up appointment.\nIn 2015, the patient revisited our department for the removal of the foreign body. In 2008, he felt strong traction in the right side of his face when he approached an MRI scanner for a brain image examination. He remembered that a foreign body was impacted in his face. Because it was shown to be ferromagnetic, the MRI examination was cancelled and contraindicated. He was positive for the hepatitis C virus and suffering from liver cirrhosis. Recently, hepatocellular carcinoma had developed and was treated by radiofrequency ablation. His liver function was impaired and had a Child Pugh B score in addition to thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Although esophageal varices were not observed, he needed to be strictly followed. Because MRI examination was necessary to evaluate this condition, the removal of the foreign body was reconsidered. The patient’s face was symmetric without visible scaring from the wound (Fig. ). The foreign body was not palpable through the skin or the oral mucosa. There had been no episodes of swelling or pain on the right side of his face since the last visit. Panorama and posteroanterior X-ray (Fig. and ) and CT (Fig. and ) examination showed that the foreign body was present at the same site as 8 years prior.\nConsultations with internal medicine and the anesthesiology department were made. The patient’s general condition was strictly controlled before surgery. Removal of the foreign body was performed under general anesthesia. An incision was made along the right anterior mandibular ramus. Soft tissue under the masseter muscle was dissected over the periosteum of the mandibular ramus (Fig. ). The foreign body was not visible from the incision but was palpable by the finger of the surgeon. Care was taken not to cause the migration of the foreign body into the deep space. After blunt dissection of the surrounding tissue by the finger of the surgeon, the object was removed with forceps. The wound was gently irrigated with saline and hemostasis was confirmed. The wound was closed by suturing after the insertion of a silicone drain. The foreign body was 12 × 5 × 1 mm and weighed 0.48 g (Fig. ). It was ferromagnetic and attracted to a magnet (Fig. ).\nThe patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Swelling around the wound was minimal and no postoperative bleeding or infection was observed. The drain and the threads were removed 2 days and 7 days after surgery, respectively. Postoperative X-ray examination revealed that the foreign body was removed and no residual radiopaque materials were observed. The patient was discharged and received follow-up as an outpatient. Since surgery, he has been in generally stable condition with no complications related to surgery.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Patient followed for nearly two years with a mediastinal mass', 'Referred for further evaluation'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousDiagnosis': 'Mediastinal mass near left cardiac margin'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Chest roentgenogram', 'Finding': 'Well-circumscribed mass in the middle zone of the left lung field'}, {'Test': 'Chest tomography', 'Finding': 'Well-circumscribed huge cystic mass near aortic arch and left pulmonary artery, small cystic mass on sixth costosternal junction'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Mediastinal masses', 'Type': 'Cystic and nodular solid masses', 'Location': 'Near aortic arch, left pulmonary artery, and sixth costosternal junction'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Surgery for mass removal and coronary artery bypass grafting', 'Details': 'One-stage combined operation involving sternotomy'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Discharged on the sixth day after the operation', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition with slightly elevated left diaphragm and voice hoarseness'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'One year', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Fully recovered with no recurrence or metastasis'}}}"
"A 12-year-old Brazilian female, with no systemic comorbidities, attended the oral and maxillofacial surgery service with a chief complaint of a painless growing facial swelling for 8 months (). On extraoral examination, a unilateral expansive lesion was detected on the lower right aspect of her face. On intraoral examination, the swelling could be seen affecting the body and the angle of the mandible on the right side associated with her lower right third molar. Panoramic radiographic examination revealed a unilocular radiolucent lesion extending from the body of the mandible through to the angle and right ascending ramus, causing displacement of the second molar towards the base of the mandible and the third molar towards the ascending ramus (). A CT scan revealed that the lesion caused expansion of the buccal and lingual aspects of the cortical bone with areas of fenestration. Needle aspiration was performed to evaluate the contents of the swelling, mainly to exclude the possibility of a vascular lesion. An incisional biopsy was then performed, and the specimen was sent for histological evaluation (). The access window left from the biopsy was used to accommodate a flexible tube for decompression and subsequent volume reduction of the lesion in an attempt to minimize the need for mutilating surgery in such a young patient. In view of the clinical and radiographic characteristics, two differential diagnoses were raised, namely, unicystic ameloblastoma or dentigerous cyst (). The histological diagnosis confirmed the suspicion of a unicystic ameloblastoma. A decision was made to continue with the assisted decompression approach using daily irrigations of sterile saline solution intercalated with 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate to remove debris and decontaminate the site, which was followed up both clinically and radiographically. After 5 months of decompression, a significant reduction of the lesion was observed radiographically, with evidence of bone neoformation in the periphery of the lesion. In view of the favorable progression, complete enucleation of the lesion combined with peripheral osteotomy and cryotherapy was performed under general anesthesia to reduce the risk of recurrence. The excised specimen was sent for histopathological evaluation, which reiterated the previous diagnosis of unicystic ameloblastoma. The patient has been followed up for 6 months, with no clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrence (). A supernumerary tooth in the right maxilla was also observed in the panoramic radiograph. This tooth was not removed since cone beam computed tomography was not available for a better surgical planning due to financial reasons. However, the patient remains in close follow-up.\nThe histological sections showed the presence of a fibrous capsule lined by nonkeratinized stratified pavement epithelium exhibiting spongiosis, reverse polarization of the basal layer, and areas that resembled the stellate reticulum. The fibrous capsule consisted of dense connective tissue, presenting moderate to severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate and hemorrhagic areas ().","{

"The index patient was a 34-year old female referred to the bariatric clinic by the general practitioner on her own request to treat her morbid obesity. She was born with a normal birth weight but large head circumference for which she never had a diagnostic analysis. At the age of five, her body weight was already significantly higher compared to her peers. No specific life events could explain her obesity. Cognitive development was normal and she followed normal education. She underwent treatment for recurrent nasal polyps. Her mother also had a large head size and suffered from morbid obesity as well. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and died from a pulmonary embolism after placement of an Adjustable Gastric Band. A maternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 and the maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at young age. The younger sister of the index patient was overweight and was reported to also have a large head size (Figure ).\nSince childhood, the index patient followed several different coaching programs to change her eating behavior and exercise pattern to induce weight loss. She lost weight several times but was never able to maintain her weight loss. At the time of the intake procedure at the bariatric clinic, her height was 1.69 m (SD −0.2) and weight 164 kg (SD +6.8), resulting in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 57.6 kg/m2 and a predominant abdominal obesity. Head size was not measured at that time since this is not part of bariatric screening procedures. Biochemical analysis of the blood revealed no abnormalities, and excluded endocrine hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism. The fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM.\nThe combination of early onset morbid obesity resulted in suspicion of a genetic cause of her obesity. She was offered diagnostic genetic analysis of 52 obesity–associated genes to identify a possible underlying genetic obesity cause.\nThe patient was eligible for bariatric surgery and underwent a sleeve gastrectomy without complications (performed in 2014 using a standardized fashion). At 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery, she achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss of 39.4, 48.8 and 44.9, respectively. This resulted in a current BMI of 30.1 kg/m2. This was within the range of the results which were observed in a control group of 18 female patients, with a negative obesity genetic test result. These female patients were matched for age and BMI and achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss (TBWL) of 30.3 after 1 year, 31 after 2 years and 30 after 3 years of follow-up.\nA few months after surgery, the result of the obesity gene panel analysis was returned and showed heterozygosity for a known pathogenic mutation in the PTEN gene (): c.202T>C p.(Tyr68His). This mutation has been described previously in patients with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PTEN HTS) (Marsh et al., ). No other pathogenic mutations were shown in the remaining 50 obesity–associated genes (Table ). At the genetic clinic, a head circumference of 63 cm (+5SD) and pedigree analysis (family history of multiple tumors) further supported the molecular diagnosis of PTEN HTS.\nAccording to the PTEN HTS guidelines, patients with pathogenic PTEN mutations are advised to visit the outpatient clinic for familial tumors, for lifelong surveillance of tumors that are associated with the PTEN mutations (Dutch Guidelines, ; Eng, ). Our patient underwent additional biochemical laboratory- and ultrasound screening to exclude thyroid gland carcinoma. Besides a few benign nodules on the ultrasound, no abnormalities could be determined. A yearly follow-up ultrasound of her thyroid gland and yearly serum thyroid stimulating hormone analysis was advised. Screening for breast, endometrium and colorectal cancer, also revealed no anomalies.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Sudden onset of pain and watering in the left eye for 4 days'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PastHistory': 'Myopia since age 12, radial keratotomy for myopic correction at 20, followed by secondary angle closure glaucoma in left eye'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Intraocular Pressure Measurement', 'Finding': '40 mmHg in left eye'}, {'Test': 'Posterior Segment Examination', 'Finding': 'Glaucomatous optic atrophy in left eye'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Corneal Melting and Perforation', 'Type': 'Complication post radial keratotomy', 'Location': 'Left eye'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Conservative Management', 'Details': 'Cyanoacrylate glue, bandage contact lens, topical antibiotics, cycloplegics, lubricating drops'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Corneal edema decreased, perforation healed, leucomatous corneal opacity at the involved site'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Ongoing', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Improved vision in right eye, regular follow-up'}}}"
"A 55 year old female patient diagnosed with epilepsy and under follow up developed generalized tonic clonic seizure that lasted for 5 minutes. The emergency department team was informed and she was brought to the emergency department. On arriving at the site the emergency team where the patient had the seizure, found her lying in a supin position with a foamy mouth and bitten tongue. A 2 cm cut was seen at the back of the head most probably as a result of falling and hitting it. The patient was found to have difficulty in breathing and after suction of the mouth, oxygen was administered. The general clinical condition being quite poor and having an apneic respiratory pattern, the patient was immediately intubated. The patient was unconscious with a blood pressure level of 80/60 mm Hg and pulse count of 66/min. Light reflexes were normal in the patient, there were no verbal and pain responses and the Babinski sign was bilateraly unresponsive. The patient was brought to the hospital by the emergency team in an intubated state and admitted to the neurology intensive care unit. The patient's hematologic and biochemical tests were unremarkable and the carbamazepine levels were found to be 3.8 µg/mL (4–12). The patient had been diagnosed with epilepsy and under follow up for 40 years, had a moderate level of mental retardation, did not use her medical treatment (carbamazepine 800 mg/day) regularly and failed to go for her routine medical checkups. It was also learned that she develops once or twice a month generalized tonic clonic seizures and that during some of these seizures she has suffered small injuries but had not had any fatal trauma or accident. Antiepileptic treatment was started and on the 6th hour of follow up consciousness was regained and flask quadriplegia was seen on neurologic examination. A cervical MRI was taken and a severe spinal cord compression, widespread spinal cord edema and also subluxation at C3–4 were seen due to fracture of the lower back part of C3 vertebra most probably as a result of trauma (, ). The patient was diagnosed with flask quadriplegia due to cervical fracture. Surgical operation was not recommended by the neurosurgery department because the patient had low arterial blood pressure during her follow-ups, had bradycardia and could not be separated from the mechanical ventilator due to respiratory acidosis. The patient was given pulse steroid therapy. Antiepileptic, inotropic and fluid therapy was administered. The patient died on the 2nd day of treatment.","{

"A 34 year old right hand-dominant male, who works as a chef, presented with a 4 month history of left wrist mass. It had increased rapidly in size during the final month. The patient also began to experience numbness of his left thumb, index and middle fingers. He was normally well and not on regular medications. There was no family history of note.\nAn ultrasound was initially performed which showed a large, complex cystic structure within the carpal tunnel. A subsequent MRI revealed a heterogeneous, well defined mass with fluid and solid components. The mass was located middle and ring fingers. It appeared to arise from the tendon sheath of the middle and ring finger flexors, but was not between the superficial and deep flexor tendon sheaths of the invading the tendons. It extended distally to the carpal tunnel, with overall dimensions of 19 x 24 x 38 mm. It showed peripheral enhancement and areas of necrosis, and there was no flow void (Fig. ). The median nerve had a normal appearance. In light of the clinical history and radiological features, a malignant lesion such a synovial sarcoma, was considered the likely provisional diagnosis.\nThe patient was referred to our unit for urgent review. On examination he had a mobile and palpable mass which moved from the mid palm to the volar wrist region with flexion and extension of his wrist. The mass was not adherent to overlying skin. He had full power in his left hand and there was no thenar muscle wasting. He had decreased sensation in his thumb, index and middle finger, and Tinel’s test was negative.\nHe underwent surgical exploration and removal of tumour within one week of the consultation. An extended carpal tunnel incision was made (Fig. ), from the mid palm to the volar wrist. After the TCL was divided, a large tan coloured soft-tissue tumor was visible on the ulnar aspect of the median nerve. It appeared to arise from the deep flexor tendon sheath of the ring finger, extending distally to the lumbrical muscle of the 4th ray, and it infiltrated these structures only minimally. A persistent median artery was observed overlying the median nerve, which did not appear to be involved by the tumour. The tumour was resected with macroscopic margins. Post-operative recovery was uneventful and the patient reported immediate relief of compressive median nerve symptoms.\nHistological analysis was consistent with a synovial haemangioma, comprising of numerous thin-walled blood vessels with a central cystic cavity filled with blood and fibrin (Fig. ). There was no evidence of malignancy.\nA three month follow-up confirmed complete resolution of his neurosensory symptoms and showed a well healing scar.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['No symptoms, incidental finding of right adrenal lesion'], 'MedicalHistory': {}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Right adrenal lesion of 9 cm'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal MRI', 'Finding': 'Soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10x9 cm of right adrenal gland origin'}, {'Test': 'Adrenal scan', 'Finding': 'Well encapsulated 10x9x7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications without local invasion'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Benign schwannoma', 'Type': 'Benign tumor', 'Location': 'Right adrenal gland'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy', 'Details': 'Converted to open surgery due to tumor adherence to IVC and renal vein'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uncomplicated', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged on the sixth day after surgery'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'N/A', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Histologically proven benign tumor'}}}"
"The index patient was a 34-year old female referred to the bariatric clinic by the general practitioner on her own request to treat her morbid obesity. She was born with a normal birth weight but large head circumference for which she never had a diagnostic analysis. At the age of five, her body weight was already significantly higher compared to her peers. No specific life events could explain her obesity. Cognitive development was normal and she followed normal education. She underwent treatment for recurrent nasal polyps. Her mother also had a large head size and suffered from morbid obesity as well. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and died from a pulmonary embolism after placement of an Adjustable Gastric Band. A maternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 and the maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at young age. The younger sister of the index patient was overweight and was reported to also have a large head size (Figure ).\nSince childhood, the index patient followed several different coaching programs to change her eating behavior and exercise pattern to induce weight loss. She lost weight several times but was never able to maintain her weight loss. At the time of the intake procedure at the bariatric clinic, her height was 1.69 m (SD −0.2) and weight 164 kg (SD +6.8), resulting in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 57.6 kg/m2 and a predominant abdominal obesity. Head size was not measured at that time since this is not part of bariatric screening procedures. Biochemical analysis of the blood revealed no abnormalities, and excluded endocrine hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism. The fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM.\nThe combination of early onset morbid obesity resulted in suspicion of a genetic cause of her obesity. She was offered diagnostic genetic analysis of 52 obesity–associated genes to identify a possible underlying genetic obesity cause.\nThe patient was eligible for bariatric surgery and underwent a sleeve gastrectomy without complications (performed in 2014 using a standardized fashion). At 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery, she achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss of 39.4, 48.8 and 44.9, respectively. This resulted in a current BMI of 30.1 kg/m2. This was within the range of the results which were observed in a control group of 18 female patients, with a negative obesity genetic test result. These female patients were matched for age and BMI and achieved a percentage Total Body Weight Loss (TBWL) of 30.3 after 1 year, 31 after 2 years and 30 after 3 years of follow-up.\nA few months after surgery, the result of the obesity gene panel analysis was returned and showed heterozygosity for a known pathogenic mutation in the PTEN gene (): c.202T>C p.(Tyr68His). This mutation has been described previously in patients with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PTEN HTS) (Marsh et al., ). No other pathogenic mutations were shown in the remaining 50 obesity–associated genes (Table ). At the genetic clinic, a head circumference of 63 cm (+5SD) and pedigree analysis (family history of multiple tumors) further supported the molecular diagnosis of PTEN HTS.\nAccording to the PTEN HTS guidelines, patients with pathogenic PTEN mutations are advised to visit the outpatient clinic for familial tumors, for lifelong surveillance of tumors that are associated with the PTEN mutations (Dutch Guidelines, ; Eng, ). Our patient underwent additional biochemical laboratory- and ultrasound screening to exclude thyroid gland carcinoma. Besides a few benign nodules on the ultrasound, no abnormalities could be determined. A yearly follow-up ultrasound of her thyroid gland and yearly serum thyroid stimulating hormone analysis was advised. Screening for breast, endometrium and colorectal cancer, also revealed no anomalies.","{

"The first patient (P1) was a 68-year old female, retired from work, and living with her husband. A few years ago she had had problems with her right jaw when chewing. Ever since then she had felt that her jaw was tense. At some point, she started to have light headaches now and then that accelerated to headaches almost every day. The headache was usually present already when she woke up in the morning. It seemed to get somewhat worse during days when she was stressed. She perceived her jaw muscles as tense and tender. She had low-intensity headaches most of the days ( and ), with no perceived disability but affecting feelings of happiness in activities with family and friends (). Her self-efficacy for managing headache (HMSE) was low (). She used analgesics but not that much that it would be a primary problem behavior ().\nIn the FBA, it was hypothesized that the behavior that would have most effect on her headaches was her continuous contracting of jaws. Therefore, the behavior of contracting the jaw muscles was analyzed in order to understand the function of the behavior. The behavior seemed to be going on almost all the time, even during nights, and in that way it had become more or less automatic. The antecedents and consequences of this behavior were therefore hard to identify. However, it could be concluded that the behavior was intensified in situations with psychological stress, for example, worrying about family members being ill. She was motivated for changing her behavior.\nThe long-term goal was set to no headache more than twice a week. It was concluded that the primary purpose of the treatment would be to find a way for her to increase the control of tension of the jaw during the daytime activities. It was hypothesized that the jaw muscles would continue to be relaxed during the nights if they were relaxed during the days.\nThe treatment consisted of eight visits with home exercises in between, including two follow-up visits.\nBasic skills targeted were to know and feel what is a neutral relaxed position of the jaw, to be able to control the muscular tension, and to do her exercises regularly. Applied skills targeted were to recognize when her jaw gets tense in the activities and to do the exercises when necessary to decrease tension. Generalization of the skills was not needed.\nThe behavior change techniques of self-monitoring, feedback, reevaluation of goals, shaping, and fading were used, and the physical therapist aimed to strengthen the patient’s self-efficacy for behavior change through reinforcement of every progress during all treatment stages.\nAll outcomes were considered as proxy measures for increased control of the tension of jaw muscles.\nThe goal of no headache more than twice a week was met.\nHeadache frequency and headache index are presented in and . During baseline, she had headaches at 6 out of 7 days and during the two follow-up visits these figures were 1 and 2 out of 7 days, respectively.\nThe behavior of consumption of analgesics is presented in and was reduced to zero at the follow-ups.\nDisability and feelings of loss of happiness: she reported no disability in activities during any of the phases. Loss of happiness was reduced to zero after treatment and was stable through follow-up ().\nHMSE score increased considerably from baseline to directly after the treatment and was stable through followup ().","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Routine checkup showed slightly elevated liver enzymes', 'Abdominal ultrasound revealed right adrenal lesion'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousHealth': 'Previously healthy'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Abdominal ultrasound', 'Finding': 'Right adrenal lesion of 9 cm'}, {'Test': 'Abdominal MRI', 'Finding': 'Encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm in right adrenal gland'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Benign schwannoma', 'Type': 'Non-secreting adrenal mass', 'Location': 'Right adrenal gland'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Right laparoscopic trans-peritoneal adrenalectomy', 'Details': 'Converted to open surgery due to adherence to major vessels'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Uneventful', 'DischargeStatus': 'Good condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Six days post-surgery', 'FunctionalStatus': 'No complications post-discharge'}}}"
"During the dissection of a 91-year-old female cadaver, whose cause of death was reported as Alzheimer's disease, an enlarged gallbladder filled with approximately 350 ml of thin bilious fluid was identified. This gallbladder was normally situated in the fossa for the gallbladder. Upon opening, a prominent transverse partial septation in the body was found. This partial septum was located near the infundibulum (Hartmann's pouch) and this divided the gallbladder into a smaller chamber near the opening of the cystic duct and a larger chamber near the fundus (). There was a one centimeter opening between the two chambers allowing communication of fluid. No stones, mucus, or obstructive masses were found in the gallbladder or along its path of drainage into the duodenum. The diameter of the biliary duct system appeared enlarged; the cystic duct measured 12 mm (normal 2-3 mm), the hepatic duct 18 mm (normal 6 mm) and the common bile duct 21 mm (normal 7 mm), in the collapsed state [,]. The common bile duct, near its termination, measured 7 mm with a patent opening into the pancreaticobiliary antrum (). No anatomical explanation for the enlarged ductal system was found. It is possible that the patient passed a gallstone prior to death, causing a constriction at the pancreaticobiliary antrum and subsequent dilation of the biliary tree, but this is only conjecture. The gallbladder wall was of normal thickness and had no evidence of past inflammation in the form of adhesions or other structural changes. The liver appeared grossly normal. The authors hypothesize this septal abnormality was congenital and during life may have caused symptoms of biliary colic due to the septum intermittently obstructing the cystic duct during contraction of the gallbladder; this may have resulted in incomplete emptying of the gallbladder and subsequent enlargement.\nIn addition to the enlarged gallbladder, an aberrant right hepatic artery and an accessory left hepatic artery were found. The left hepatic artery was normally located but there was also an accessory left hepatic artery originating from the left gastric artery. The right hepatic artery originated from the superior mesenteric artery (, ). To our knowledge, this combination of a transverse septum with such vascular anomalies has not been reported in the literature (). The vascular variations are likely unrelated to the enlargement of the gallbladder, as there has been no record of these variations causing enlargement of the gallbladder nor development of a partial transverse septum.","{

"Susan is a 51-year-old woman. As an adolescent, she developed scoliosis. Working as a hairstylist when she was 18 or 19, she began to have severe pain in her hands, making her work very difficult. She had carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand which provided temporary relief. Her symptoms slowly returned and she continued to have intense pain and difficulty with her daily activities. Seeking relief from her symptoms, she received treatment from chiropractors and Chinese medicine practitioners with no significant benefit. She also tried yoga and swimming but depending on the yoga movements or swimming strokes, she began to have more pain.\nWhen she was in her early forties, she began to have weakness in the lower half of her body. Her legs would frequently give out on the stairs, causing her to fall. Control of her bladder and bowel function also began to deteriorate. She had an MRI, and based on the results, she was scheduled for emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. She was informed that it would be an outpatient surgery and she would be home the same day.\nIn May 2011, Susan had a 6-level cervical spine fusion to stabilize her spine and relieve pressure on her spinal cord. When she woke up, she realized something was wrong. The entire right side of her body was paralyzed. What was supposed to be an outpatient surgery with a return home the same day ended up being an 8-week hospital and rehabilitation stay to learn how to walk again.\nIn August 2012, a second surgery was performed with the goal of pain relief. However, she reported her pain was significantly worse afterwards. She would receive weekly injections for pain relief that she reports would only marginally decrease her pain for about one week. She was also taking high doses of medication for nerve pain relief which she also reports provided marginal benefit. She had areas of heightened sensitivity on her legs where a bed sheet or even a gentle breeze would cause intense pain. Exposure to hot water would feel cold, and cold water would feel hot. She was unable to walk more than one block and remained in bed for over ten hours per day. She suffered extensive personal and professional quality of life losses at this time.\nLooking for relief, she tried medical yoga and received temporary relief. She also practiced traditional Tai Chi which provided minimal to no relief. She continued to have intense pain which had a significant impact on her quality of life and ability to perform daily tasks, including walking. In 2014, she tried a Qigong class and reported feeling that there was something very different about this class. Almost immediately, she felt a strong sense of relaxation that she had reportedly not found in many years. She was unable to attend many classes, so she purchased a video of the movements. Over the next year, she began to practice the exercises consistently until she could attend formal classes.\nSusan credits the practice of qigong with saving her life. She says it gave her a reason to get out of bed and socialize in the very early days of her practice. She is now able to walk with no limitations and her pain has improved by approximately 90%. Within three months of beginning qigong, she was able to stop all medications and injections she was receiving for pain relief. She continues to have some weakness in her arms and her hands, but it does not interfere with her ability to complete her daily activities. Despite her extensive cervical spine surgery, she reports full mobility in her shoulders and has nearly recovered full mobility in her neck. Her energy has also greatly improved and she routinely teaches three Qigong classes per week. In addition to this, she teaches at special events, including a Qigong class at a large yoga festival with over 1000 people in attendance. Recently, she started her first full time job in over six years.\nJames is a 70-year-old male. Over ten years ago, he was diagnosed with multi-level degenerative disc disease (DDD) in his lumbar spine, as well as severe central stenosis or narrowing of his spinal column around his spinal cord at L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1. In 2011, he had a CT scan and was told by his physician that it would not be long until he must rely on a wheelchair for all mobility. Surgery was presented as an option, but he was informed that the success rate was less than 10%.\nHe decided to forgo surgery and take his chances. Gradually, his legs became weaker and he would fall spontaneously. He worked as a salesman and as he was talking to clients, his legs would give out without warning and he would fall to the ground. To help his situation, he would park as close as he could to the entrance of stores or other destinations and would walk with carts or holding onto shelves or furniture. This would only help for so long before he would fall again.\nHe began looking for other options to help manage his condition. In 2012, he tried yoga. While it helped to temporarily control his pain, it had no effect on the weakness in his legs and he would continue to fall. One year later, at the suggestion of his wife, he tried a Qigong class. Due to his family’s personal schedules, he was unable to attend another class for two months. He decided to purchase a video of the movements he had learned and practiced them each day for 4–5 months until he was able to return to normal classes.\nSince participating in Qigong classes, he has not fallen even once, and has no reports of pain. He stated that “Qigong gave me my life back.” He has no other medical problems to mention and takes no medications. He revealed that the improvements he has experienced have gone far beyond what he expected. Where he used to fall often and without notice, he has not fallen since he began qigong and reports that he now even has a “spring to his step, and a spring in his heart.” Not too long ago, he sustained a left rotator cuff tear. After continuing to practice qigong, he had a full return of strength and movement with no pain or difficulty with his routine daily activities, all within six months.\nIn his professional life, he felt like he was burning out as an IT programmer but practicing qigong has reinvigorated him. He was able to complete many projects (some complex) that he never would have thought possible. He has since become certified to teach Qigong and tells anyone who will listen about his story. He has also witnessed many others gain significant benefit from the practice of Qigong and is thrilled that he gets to share this with others.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Chief complaint of right alar swelling with hard pain for 1 month', 'Physical examination revealed submucosal tumor in right nasal vestibule'], 'MedicalHistory': {'Injuries': 'Recurrent end-stage lung cancer and diabetes'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Biopsy', 'Finding': 'Suspected malignancy'}, {'Test': 'CT scan', 'Finding': 'Round lesion 1 cm in length in right nasal vestibule'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma', 'Type': 'Malignant', 'Location': 'Nasal vestibule'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Minimally invasive surgery under local anesthesia', 'Details': 'Resection of nasal vestibular tumor using right alar and gingival incision approach'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Right nasal pain disappeared, discharged 4 days post-op'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': '6 months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Patient desired palliative care and passed away at home'}}}"
"A 21-year-old woman with SCD presented frequently to the medical casualty department with severe pain due to sickle cell VOC. For the last 2 years, her sickle cell pain included intermittent pain in the left ankle. Her recurrent severe VOCs were treated with opioids, as they are the general treatment in such patients. She had experienced osteomyelitis in the right ulnar bone 12 years previously, which resolved after intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Additionally, she underwent splenectomy 4 years ago to reduce blood transfusion requirements because of her congenital hemolytic anemia. She was referred for a triple-phase bone scan and complementary bone marrow and infection imaging as part of the SCD research project. A plain radiograph of the left foot was normal, but SPECT-CT revealed an increased uptake in the shoulders, knees, and sternum on blood pool and delayed images, consistent with marrow expansion. A similar uptake pattern was seen during bone marrow study, confirming bone marrow expansion around the large joints. There was a mildly increased blood pool and bone uptake in the left ankle involving the proximal talus and the region of the medial malleolus, with focal increased uptake in the left talus. This nidus of activity appeared to correspond to a round lucent area surrounded by a dense sclerotic rim and sinus tract formation together with a fracture line in the proximal talus on CT. The WBC scan showed no evidence of significant uptake, and the bone marrow scan showed asymmetrical uptake between the two ankles without a cold lesion in the left talus, which is consistent with moderate bone marrow expansion. The CT and bone scan findings suggested Brodie’s abscess in the proximal left talus with possible surrounding chronic osteomyelitis. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for 10 days with no response. The abscess was then treated with surgical curettage under general anesthesia and antibiotic administration for 10 days. At 18 months after removal of the abscess, the patient did not have pain or swelling at the site of the abscess even with sickle cell VOC.","{

"A 24-year-old Saudi male was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for consultation and treatment of repeated infection and pain in the right side of the lower jaw of over one-year duration. He also complained of bad odor and difficulty to open his mouth during the same period. On examination intra-orally, a hard bone-like structure with a rough surface exposed to the oral cavity distal to the right lower second molar was seen. Plaque accumulation over the mass with very foul odor and bad oral hygiene was noticed. The hard mass fenestrated the lingual tissues together with the gingival surrounding the lesion appearing very inflamed (Figures ). Ortho-pantomo-graphic x-ray view showed a calcified mass distal to the lower right second molar, with the third molar on that side being displaced distally by the present mass. The calcified mass was encircled inferiorly on its central part by a radiolucent halo with the inferior dental canal being more inferiorly placed to the lesion. The lower right second molar showed advanced periodontal involvement with bone loss but without any resorption of its distal root ().\nHe consented for the potential complications of surgically removing the mass in terms of inferior alveolar and lingual nerves injury, and possible pathologic fracture of the right side of the lower jaw while removing the lesion. The proposed treatment plan also included disimpaction of lower right third molar and extraction of periodontally involved second molar. He accepted the proposed treatment under local anesthesia but refused the extraction of the lower right second molar. Under local anesthesia, the surgical removal of the lower right third molar in addition to the calcified mass together with curettage of the infected soft tissues in the area was carried over. The specimens sent for histopathological examination included the soft tissues around the lesion and the hard, calcified lesion. The healing course postoperatively was uneventful without any neural defect of the related nerves.\nHistopathological report showed that the soft tissue specimen stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E stain) composed of inflammatory cells, necrotic debris, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal epithelial fragments. While the calcified specimen also stained with H&E stain showed irregular areas of decalcified dentine and enamel with a final diagnosis of complex odontome associated with infected tissues (Figures ).","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['Severe swelling and pain in the right lower extremity', 'Venous ulcer at right medial malleolus'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousMedicalHistory': 'Papillary urothelial carcinoma of bladder, Radical cystectomy, Ureterostomy', 'RecentHistory': 'Recurrence of malignancy, Bilateral diffuse lung metastasis, 12 courses of chemotherapy'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Finding': 'Mass at right side of pelvis compressing right external iliac vein'}, {'Test': 'Lung Computed Tomography', 'Finding': 'Bilateral diffuse lung metastasis'}, {'Test': 'Venography', 'Finding': 'Severe stenosis and invasion of pelvic mass into right external iliac vein'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'Symptomatic venous stenosis and invasion from pelvic mass', 'Type': 'Venous obstruction', 'Location': 'Right external iliac vein'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Endovascular stent placement', 'Details': 'Stenting of external iliac vein with venoplasty and balloon dilatation'}, 'PostoperativeCourse': {'Recovery': 'Dramatic clinical response since postoperative day two', 'DischargeStatus': 'Stable'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Three and six months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Swelling and venous ulcer resolved, Normal venous flow on duplex study'}}}"
"A 68-year-old woman with a history of previous abdominal surgery presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. One day prior to admission, she noted the gradual onset of abdominal pain. She had one bowel movement but the abdominal pain persisted. The pain was intermittent and gradually worsened. She vomited several times. She underwent a hernia repair 15 years previously and had a lower midline incision, although the details of that procedure were unavailable. On physical examination, her lower abdomen was slightly distended with mild tenderness to palpation. Dilated intestine was palpable, but there were no signs of peritonitis. Nasogastric suction was initiated but inadequate and the abdominal pain persisted. Abdominal CT scan revealed dilated loops of small intestine with a small amount of ascites.\nThe diagnosis of small bowel obstruction was established and exploration undertaken. This was begun laparoscopically which demonstrated multiple areas of adherent loops of small bowel. The adhesions were lysed sharply and further exploration revealed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired in a conventional manner after conversion to open laparotomy.\nOn postoperative day (POD) 1, her temperature increased to 39°C; however, it resolved over five days without specific treatment. The abdominal pain persisted and became more intense on POD 6. Abdominal CT scan was performed on POD 7, which showed a small fluid collection with some air. Due to persistence and increasing severity of the abdominal pain, repeat operative exploration was undertaken on POD 8. Exploration revealed abscesses in the abdominal wall and between loops of small bowel, as well as a site of perforation, which was resected and repaired with a primary anastomosis.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful except for persistent anorexia. Ten days after the second exploration, CT scan was obtained due to the persistent anorexia. The CT scan revealed edematous small intestine and dilatation of the mesenteric veins. The scan also revealed a filling defect in the superior mesenteric vein () suggestive of a thrombus. She had no evidence of intestinal gangrene or peritonitis, and systemic heparin was begun followed by warfarin therapy. Laboratory data were not consistent with protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiencies. She had no past history or family history of deep venous thrombosis or other coagulation disorders. Over the next six days, the thrombus resolved on repeat imaging studies (), and her appetite recovered. She was discharged without further complications, continuing oral anticoagulation with warfarin.","{

"An 82-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with hip pain and an inability to weight bear following a simple mechanical fall at home. She had a past medical history of chronic kidney disease following curative right total nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma several years before but was otherwise in good health. On examination her leg was shortened and externally rotated. AP and lateral radiographs of her hip confirmed an extracapsular neck of femur fracture, as shown in . After discussion with the patient and her family, consent was taken for internal fixation of the fracture using a dynamic hip screw. Preoperative blood workup revealed a mild anaemia (Hb of 110 g/L) and chronic kidney disease stage 3.\nSurgery was performed on the following day's trauma list by a registrar under image intensifier guidance, as shown in . The procedure was supervised by a consultant surgeon. The procedure appeared to be routine with no intraoperative complications noted. The following day the patient had a persistent tachycardia with low oxygen saturations on arterial blood gas sampling. A NM V/Q SPECT (ventilation/perfusion) scan was arranged which revealed a mismatch in the midzone of the left lung, consistent with a pulmonary embolism. After review by the medical team she was started on treatment dose enoxaparin.\nOver the next week she had episodes of intermittent tachycardia and low blood pressure. Her haemoglobin fell from 110 g/L to 80 g/L despite a 3 unit red blood cell transfusion. There were no signs of external bleeding and the surgical wound was clean and dry. Several days after surgery she developed extensive proximal thigh bruising over a 24-hour period, raising the possibility of bleeding from around the fracture site. CT angiography demonstrated a large left thigh haematoma extending along the femoral sheath and a small area of active extravasation of contrast relating to a branch of the profunda femoris artery. Angiography was performed demonstrating a pseudoaneurysm arising from a branch of the proximal profunda corresponding to the abnormality seen on the preceding CT angiogram, as shown in . The small supplying vessel was catheterised with difficulty using a microcatheter but a stable position could not be achieved here for embolisation. Therefore the main vessel was embolised at this point using 5 mm and 6 mm 0.035 coils, with preservation of large profunda branches above and below. Follow-up angiography revealed no further active haemorrhage of filling of the pseudoaneurysm, as shown in . A Cook Celect retrievable IVC filter was deployed within the infrarenal vena cava. After several days of no further bleeding, warfarin was commenced and the patient was discharged to a community rehabilitation facility. While the pseudoaneurysm did delay her discharge and rehabilitation, she has progressed to make a full recovery.","{'PatientInformation': {'ChiefComplaints': ['History of prothrombin gene mutation', 'Spontaneous subclavian and brachial artery thrombosis 17 years ago', 'Venous thrombosis of right lower extremity following arthroscopic procedure', 'End-stage renal disease in the setting of diabetes and hypertension'], 'MedicalHistory': {'PreviousInjury': 'Left subclavian and brachial artery thrombosis', 'ProthrombinGeneMutation': 'Heterozygous form of the prothrombin gene 20210 mutation'}, 'DiagnosticFindings': [{'Test': 'Ultrasound examination', 'Finding': 'No evidence of clots or thrombi in internal jugular vein or vessels before central venous catheter placement'}]}, 'Diagnosis': {'Disease': {'Name': 'End-stage renal disease', 'Type': 'Chronic condition', 'Location': 'Renal system'}}, 'TreatmentAndOutcome': {'Treatment': {'Type': 'Living donor kidney transplantation', 'Details': 'Methylprednisolone and thymoglobulin for immunosuppression, heparin infusion post-operatively'}, 'Postoperative Course': {'Recovery': 'Complicated by retroperitoneal hematoma requiring re-exploration and washout', 'DischargeStatus': 'Discharged home in stable condition'}, 'FollowUp': {'Duration': 'Fifteen months', 'FunctionalStatus': 'Allograft continues to function well'}}}"
